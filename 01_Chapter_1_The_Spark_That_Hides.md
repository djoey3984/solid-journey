# Chapter 1: The Spark That Hides

Cody Guiles wakes up feeling like crap. The sun sneaks through his dollar-store curtain like an unwelcome guest. He stays flat on his back for an extra second, just long enough to hate it, before he forces himself to sit up. His mattress makes that sad squeaky sound old beds make. The sheets are twisted from how he sleeps these days: one knee bent up, one shoulder dug in, like his body's trying to curl around something that isn't there anymore. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he feels small and wound-up tight, like one of those toy cars you pull back before letting go. His brown hair is shaggy and messy, and those eyes, the ones his mom used to say had "little bits of sunshine" in them, just look tired now. He wipes his face with his palm and stares at the wall for a second before forcing himself to stand.

He stares into the dusty floor mirror. The guy looking back isn't really him anymore. Just some robot going through the motions to keep everyone else happy. He's built solid enough, with decent shoulders that used to mean something when he wore pads. Captain, junior year. The guy who saw plays before they happened, who read defenses like other people read street signs, who made the calls that mattered. State semifinals. Scholarship talk. A future that actually looked like something.

Then came senior year. One bad moment. One swing he couldn't take back. And just like that, the guy in the mirror became someone else.

His eyes remind him of those birthday candles that won't stay lit no matter how many times you try. His hair's grown out too long, plastered to his forehead from sleep like a bad haircut in a school photo. His skin's about as colorful as printer paper, lips squeezed tight, jaw locked like he's waiting for life to punch him in the face again. Standing there, he notices how his neck, his shoulders, his hands are all just there. Present but hollow, like props in a play about someone else's life. The crappy light in his room highlights all the stuff he hates seeing: the bags under his eyes, the way he can't even fake a real smile anymore, how his mouth stays in that stubborn line that says "I'm fine" when he's anything but. Looking at himself is like seeing a stranger wearing his skin. Some dude who used to be a real person with dreams and stuff, not just a walking collection of ways to get through the day. Whatever spark he had is just a story he tells himself now, like Santa Claus or the idea that things might actually get better someday.

He grabs his clothes off the floor like he's picking up after a little kid. His T-shirt's got that soft feeling from being washed a million times, wrinkled where he dropped it yesterday. His pants are those jean-looking things with elastic ankles that gave up being blue a long time ago. The socks on his nightstand are just sad. Gray, with holes starting at the toes like they're trying to escape. He yanks the shirt over his head, wiggles into the pants, and pulls on the socks, smoothing them like he's petting a stray cat. His sneakers used to be white, maybe, but now they're the color of dirty dishwater. He ties them with the muscle memory of someone who's done it half-asleep a thousand times. Standing up, he checks himself in the mirror that hasn't been cleaned since Obama was president. Just another guy going through the motions because the world doesn't care if he wants to or not.

He opens his bedroom door to what looks like a trash tornado hit. Garbage bags were piled up against the walls like they were trying to hold the place together, and there was so much junk on the floor you couldn't even tell what color the carpet was supposed to be. His dad was passed out in the old recliner again, looking like a scarecrow that someone had knocked over and forgotten about. His shirt was all yellow around the neck, with food stains making a connect-the-dots puzzle down the front, and dark patches under the arms. His hair was stuck to his head like he'd gone swimming in cooking oil, his beard was growing in every direction except the right one, and his face was shiny with sweat. Empty bourbon bottles were scattered around his feet like bowling pins after a strike, and the whole place smelled like a mix of booze, B.O., and yesterday's fast food.

Cody didn't look at him. Didn't let himself.

Because when he did, something hot flickered in his chest. Not sadness. Something sharper. His hands wanted to curl into fists. His teeth pressed together until they ached. Some part of him, deep down where he kept the ugly things, wanted to grab one of those bottles and...

He killed it. Shoved it down where it couldn't breathe. Felt it settle somewhere behind his ribs, banked but not gone.

*Not today. Not ever.*

He stepped out, dodging boxes and piles of junk like he was playing a video game on expert mode. The place stank. That mix of wet basement, forgotten leftovers, and enough booze to make your eyes water. The kitchen counter was buried under dishes and takeout boxes stacked higher than a Jenga tower about to fall. He grabbed a breakfast bar from a torn-up box that looked like it had survived a flood, then fished out a water bottle that wasn't exactly cold from the sea of ketchup packets and coffee mugs with science experiments growing inside them. He headed for the door, his hand reaching for the knob like it was the finish line in a race he ran every morning.

Outside, it was freezing cold, like opening a freezer door right in your face. His crappy jacket might as well have been made of paper, and his jeans were so dirty they could practically stand up on their own. Every breath made a little cloud that disappeared in a blink. He walked to the bus stop with his hands stuffed in his pockets, watching the ground so he wouldn't trip on the busted-up sidewalk. The streetlights made that annoying buzzing sound, and half of them didn't even work right, making the street look like something out of a cheap horror movie. The bus stop sign was crooked, all beat-up looking, with a schedule you couldn't even read anymore because of all the rain.

Bus number 55 would haul him to community college. Just a bunch of ugly brick buildings where dreams went to die. He was the king of C-minus, doing just enough work not to fail, but never anything special. Some vague liberal arts degree that wouldn't get him anywhere. No real plans, just the same boring routine: get up, deal with the mess at home, ride the bus, sit through class. Rinse and repeat, until life threw another curveball his way. The bus showed up making that dying-dinosaur noise buses always make. Cody got on, swiped his pass at the little machine that never works right the first time, and found a spot in the back where nobody would bother him.

The bus was half-full. His brain did that thing it always did. Cataloged without permission. The woman in scrubs, third row, would get off at Mercy General. The kid with the backpack covered in anime pins was community college, same as him, but freshman based on the lanyard still around his neck. Nobody kept those past October. The old guy clutching the grocery bag would ride two more stops, then the senior center. The couple near the front were fighting about something, body language all wrong. Her arms crossed, his shoulders hunched forward. They wouldn't make it to Christmas.

He used to do this with defenses. Read the formation, predict the blitz, know where the hole would open before the ball was snapped. Captain of the team. The guy coaches trusted with the audibles. A lifetime ago. Now he just read bus passengers like it mattered.

Like anything mattered.

The doors shut with that snake-hiss sound, and the whole bus shook like it was cold. Cody pressed his head against the window, not because he was sad or happy or anything. He just liked how the buzzing traveled from the glass into his bones. Like one of those electric toothbrushes, but for his whole head. It reminded him he wasn't completely dead inside yet. He closed his eyes and everything turned into background noise, like when you're underwater in a swimming pool and can hear people talking but can't make out the words. His brain switched back on when the bus started slowing down like it was dragging its feet. Some garbled robot-voice shouted his stop, and he peeled his eyes open to see those ugly brick boxes they called a college staring back at him. He got up like a puppet with half its strings cut, swaying as the bus wheezed to a stop. Great. Another day of showing up just enough to not totally fail, but not enough to actually matter to anyone, including himself.
