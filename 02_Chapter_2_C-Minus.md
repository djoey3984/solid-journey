# Chapter 2: C-Minus

The professor droned on about something at the front of the room, voice flat as a dead battery. Some theory tied to some algorithm Cody already knew he'd never use. He copied a few lines from the board anyway, pen moving on autopilot, hand making shapes his brain didn't bother keeping. This was his life now. Same crap, different day, until it all blurred together.

He'd thought college might change things. New place. New faces. Maybe one moment that didn't feel like a rerun. But it turned out that without any direction, a new building was just a different wall to smack into. His life had always been like that. Every time something looked like it might finally be better, a brick wall went up and he'd hit it face-first. Same result every time.

His pen paused over the page as his brain drifted where it always drifted when he sat still too long. Back to that night. High school. State championships. The roar of the crowd, the white glare of stadium lights, the sharp smell of sweat and turf. One hard shove from the other player, one taunt that hit too close to home, and something in him snapped.

He remembered the heat of it. How fast it moved from his chest to his fists. How everything went red and quiet at the same time, like the world had narrowed down to just him and that kid's face. All the crap he'd been carrying around his whole life came pouring out through his fists. By the time coaches dragged him off, the other kid was on the ground and everyone looked at Cody like he was a monster.

The worst part wasn't the suspension. Wasn't losing his spot on the team or watching the scholarship talks dry up overnight. The worst part was how good it had felt. For about three seconds, before the horror kicked in, he'd felt more alive than he had in years.

That scared him more than anything.

Since then, the town had shut its doors. Old teammates stopped answering messages. Friends crossed the street when they saw him coming. Parents lowered their voices when he passed. Now he sat alone near the middle of a lecture hall, staring through notes he didn't care about. Half thinking of dropping this semester and disappearing somewhere else. But the notebook in front of him and the tuition tied to it were paid for with his own money. Nights and weekends at the burger place down the street, wiping grease off counters until morning. Same old routine. The only thing that still belonged to him.

Movement caught his eye. Third row, blue hoodie. The guy had been fidgeting the whole lecture, but now his hand dipped below the desk in a rhythm. Phone check. Glance at board. Phone check. Scribble. The reflection off his glasses showed the screen glow every time he looked down. Cody's pattern brain catalogued it without trying. The nervous bounce of the leg. The way he angled his body to block the girl next to him from seeing. The too-fast scribbling that didn't match the professor's pace. Cheating. Obvious if you knew what to look for.

*Not my problem.*

He went back to his notes.

Cody's phone buzzed against the desk. He glanced down, glad for the excuse to look away from the board. A text from his manager.

Can you cover tonight's shift

He didn't hesitate.

Sure. I got it.

Anything to keep him away from that apartment for a few more hours.

He slid the phone back into his pocket and forced his eyes to the front again. The professor was still going on about variables and equations, same flat voice from the start of class. The guy moved through the slides like a vending machine dispensing snacks. Push button, get lecture. No soul required. Cody watched him and saw another person who'd stopped trying a long time ago. Someone who just showed up, talked at a room of half-asleep students, collected a paycheck, and went home. Another life stuck in a rut.

"Make sure to read through the chapter on advanced equations before next class," the professor said at last.

Chairs scraped back. People started talking, some complaining, some already laughing about something else. Cody closed his notebook. He knew he'd forget most of what he'd written by tomorrow. He wasn't stupid. The information came easy enough when he tried. He just couldn't keep caring. Not when he couldn't see the point.

By lunchtime, he drifted into the campus main hall. The student lounge spread out under fluorescent lights that made everyone look a little sick. Scattered tables. Old couches sagging in the middle like they'd given up. Vending machines humming against the far wall. A TV in the corner mumbled the news, anchors talking about politics and weather in the same bored tone. Nearby, a cluster of students whispered and laughed about whatever students laugh about, voices going up and down. The air smelled like cheap pizza, burnt coffee, and reheated fries. Everything blended together into background noise. Another boring piece of a boring day. Cody found a table near the window and sat with his back to the wall. Old habit. He could see the whole room from here. His brain did its thing. The guy by the vending machine, hoodie up, shoulders hunched. Trying to decide if he could afford both a soda and chips. He'd go chips. More food for the money. The two girls on the couch were studying together, but one of them kept checking her phone and the other one had noticed. That friendship had maybe a month left. The kid at the next table over had his textbook open but hadn't turned a page in ten minutes. He was going to fail whatever test was coming.

Cody used to do this on the field. Read the defense before the snap. Know which linebacker was bluffing, which safety was going to bite on the fake. Patterns. People were just patterns if you watched long enough. Now he watched college kids pick at their lunches and wondered why he bothered. He poked at his food and scrolled through his phone, killing time until his next class.

On his way out of the lounge, he passed the lecture hall from this morning. A cluster of students stood outside, voices low but urgent. He recognized the girl who'd been sitting next to blue hoodie guy. She was crying.

"I didn't cheat," she kept saying. "I don't even have my phone. Check my bag. Check anything."

The professor stood with his arms crossed, unmoved. "The proctor saw suspicious activity in that area. You were the closest."

Blue hoodie was nowhere to be seen. Probably halfway across campus by now.

Cody should keep walking. This wasn't his fight. Getting involved never ended well for him.

His feet stopped anyway.

"It wasn't her."

Everyone turned. The professor raised an eyebrow. The girl blinked at him through wet lashes.

"Guy in the blue hoodie," Cody said. "Third row, two seats to her left. He had his phone under the desk the whole time. You could see the screen reflected in his glasses."

Silence. The professor's expression flickered. Doubt, then irritation.

"And you are?"

"Nobody." Cody shrugged. "But I was in that class. And I know what I saw."

The professor studied him for a long moment, then turned back to the girl. "We'll... look into it."

Cody didn't wait for thanks. He was already walking.

Behind him, he heard the girl's voice. "Thank you." Small. Surprised.

He didn't turn around.

By the time he got to the library that afternoon, he'd already gotten three dirty looks from people he didn't recognize. Blue hoodie's friends, probably. Word traveled fast in a small school.

*Do the right thing,* he thought. *Watch it blow up in your face. Same story, different day.*

---

Then something popped into his head. Clear as a bell.

*Study for midterms next week.*

He froze for a second. He had never planned on doing that. Cram the night before, maybe. Cheat off old notes online, sure. But actually study, days ahead? That wasn't him.

It didn't even feel like his own thought.

Cody set his phone down and stared at the table. He'd had random thoughts before. Everyone did. But this one sat different. Heavier. Like someone had dropped a rock in his skull and it was just sitting there, waiting.

*Study for midterms.*

He tried to shake it off. Went back to scrolling. But every few seconds, the thought pushed back. Insistent. Patient.

*Fine,* he thought. *You want to play this game? Let's see where it goes.*

It wasn't belief. It was curiosity. The same part of his brain that read defenses wanted to know what happened if he followed the weird impulse instead of ignoring it.

By the time his afternoon classes ended, the thought had dug in deep. He had a few hours before his shift at the burger place. Instead of killing time like usual, his feet carried him toward the library.

The campus library was big enough to hold everything the school offered, but small enough that no one ever got lost in it. It smelled like every library he'd ever been in. Paper and dust and something dry that stuck to the back of his throat. Rows of shelves lined up in neat aisles. A computer center near the entrance with old towers humming like a refrigerator on its last legs. A table of printers at the far wall spitting out papers for people who'd waited until the last minute. Cody checked his phone to see what he needed to review. As he scrolled through his notes app, the screen flickered. Went gray for a second, then snapped back.

A new line sat at the top of his notes.

*Study: The Harrowfield Incident, primary accounts and analysis.*

He blinked. He had never typed that. He'd never even heard of it. He scrolled up and down, checked the edit history, but everything looked normal. Like the line had always been there.

His pattern brain kicked in. This wasn't a glitch. Glitches didn't add complete sentences with proper punctuation. Glitches gave you gibberish or crashed the app. This was something else.

He should be freaked out. He should put the phone down and walk away and pretend this never happened.

Instead, he felt that same curiosity from before. The itch to see what happened next.

*Alright,* he thought. *Let's see what you've got.*

He walked to the front desk. The librarian on duty was a skinny nineteen-year-old with pale skin and tired eyes, a campus job lanyard hanging from their neck. Cody asked if they had anything on the Harrowfield Incident. Maybe a history text or some collection of accounts.

The librarian stared at him for a second, face blank, like the words had to travel a long way to reach them. Another zombie shuffling through the campus routine.

"I dunno," they said at last. "If we have something like that, it would be in the back corner. No one really goes there. You can check."

Cody held their gaze for a second. The kid already looked beat and he didn't feel like pushing. Not worth the effort. He gave a short nod, turned away from the desk, and headed into the library.

He passed the well-lit sections first, the shelves with colorful textbooks and new releases on display. Step by step, the lights got dimmer and the voices from the entrance faded out. By the time he reached the far corner that nobody used, the air felt heavier. Quieter. Cody turned down the narrow aisle, lined with tall shelves that looked dustier than everything else, and started looking. He ran a finger along the spines, squinting to make out the faded lettering. Cobwebs hung in the upper corners like nobody had cleaned back here in years. The air smelled stale. Dusty. Like the back of a closet that hadn't been opened since someone died.

*History of Regional Rail Systems.*
*Agricultural Policies, 1920 to 1945.*
*Collected Essays on Civic Reform.*

Nothing about Harrowfield. Nothing about any incident.

He scanned the section again, slower this time, then stood up straight with a sigh. Typical.

*Gotta do this the hard way, Guiles.*

The thought came with a dry edge he barely recognized as his own. He stepped back from the shelf, letting his eyes drift across the aisle to the next row, where the lights were even dimmer. Something pulled at him from that direction. Not a voice, but close.

Cody shifted his bag on his shoulder and moved toward the next shelf, ready to start over.

The same feeling shoved its way back into his head. Small, but heavy.

*Check again.*

It wasn't really words. More like a push that turned his shoulders before he decided to move. Cody sighed and stepped back to the shelf he'd already looked through. He let his eyes move from left to right, slower this time. Then he saw it.

*The Harrowfield Incident.*

The title sat there in dull gold letters on a dark spine, about halfway down.

His pattern brain flagged it immediately. He'd looked at this exact spot thirty seconds ago. The book hadn't been there. He was sure of it. He'd run his finger across those spines, read every title. This one would have jumped out.

But here it was. Like it had been waiting for him to pay attention.

Cody stood very still for a moment. The logical part of his brain, the part that had gotten him through eighteen years of a world that made sense, wanted to explain this away. Bad lighting. Tired eyes. He'd just missed it the first time.

The other part of his brain, the part that read patterns and predicted plays and knew when something was about to break open, that part said: *This is real. Pay attention.*

He pulled the book out. Heavier than he expected, cloth cover rough under his fingers, dust floating off the edges. He carried it to an empty desk near the window, dropped his bag on the chair next to him, and sat down. He took out his laptop, opened a blank document for notes, then flipped to the first chapter. The pages were yellow at the corners, print a little faded, but still readable. He started in.

A rural township, population listed, coordinates given. Dates. A stiff description of something that had happened in a place he'd never heard of. At first it read like every boring history book he'd ever cracked open. But the deeper he went, page after page, the more it started to get under his skin. The way the writer described the streets. The layout of the town. The way people went about their days.

Something in the back of his head stirred.

Cody frowned, leaned closer to the page, and turned to the next chapter.

And then, something happened.
