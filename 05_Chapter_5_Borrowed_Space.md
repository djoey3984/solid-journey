# Chapter 5: Borrowed Space

The late October air cut through Cody's thin jacket as they stepped onto the main path. Gray sky hung low, the kind that looked like it might rain but probably wouldn't. Wind sent leaves skittering across the brick walkway. The trees lining the quad had gone bare, branches sticking up like dead fingers, though a few stubborn oaks still held onto their brown leaves like they hadn't gotten the memo.

Lukas cut across the quad instead of taking the main paths, heading toward a line of old oaks and a narrower walkway. The big wolf moved at an easy pace, but Cody noticed how he kept himself between Cody and everyone else. A walking wall of fur and muscle in a green and black team jacket.

"So," Lukas asked, eyes forward, "what's the last thing you remember? Before you woke up in our woods."

Cody reached for the strap of his backpack, then remembered it was gone. Right. Library, then nothing. His shoulder felt wrong without it.

"I was in my college library," he said. His voice sounded too loud in the open air. "Studying for midterms. I blinked, everything went white, and then I was on the ground with a bunch of... people staring at me."

Anthro people. Wolves, foxes, something that had definitely been a raccoon in a hoodie. All standing up, all watching him like he was the weird one.

"You get used to the staring," Lukas said. His ear flicked, catching some sound behind them Cody couldn't hear. "White out and a hard landing. That tracks with the stories."

"Stories?" Cody stumbled on the word. "You're telling me this has happened before?"

"Not every week." Lukas gave him a sidelong glance, amber eyes calm. "But you're not the first human to show up somewhere you didn't mean to be. Just the first I've seen in person."

That should have helped. It didn't. If this was a known thing, then how many other people had gone missing from quiet corners of their lives and never made it back?

He shoved the thought down. *One thing at a time, Guiles.*

They passed under the oaks, and the temperature dropped in the shade. Dead leaves crunched under their feet, and the air smelled like rotting leaves and wet dirt. A breeze pushed Lukas's scent toward him again: pine, grass, something clean that might have been soap. Weirdly calming, like a locker room after a game. Sweat and detergent and routine. The campus spread out around them as they walked. Old stone buildings with ivy on the walls stood next to newer glass and steel ones. A clock tower stuck up in the distance, face just visible above the trees. Ahead, clusters of students crossed the main walks. All fur and feathers and shiny scales, their voices a low hum. Their breath made little clouds in the cold as they laughed and called to each other, bundled up in jackets and scarves.

Lukas changed their route again, picking a narrow sidewalk that went around a dorm instead of through the busy paths. Cody noticed it this time. The way the wolf's eyes checked every group they might have to pass. The way his shoulders tensed whenever someone looked too long.

At one point, Lukas steered them under an awning, then around a corner, avoiding a stretch of walkway that looked perfectly fine to Cody. He glanced back. A camera mounted on the building they'd just passed. Pointed right where they would have walked.

*Huh.*

"Your dorm is really out of the way, huh," Cody said, trying for dry and almost getting there.

"Not really." Lukas's tone stayed flat. "I just like the scenic route." Scenic route, sure. Scenic and conveniently empty.

Lukas's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, glanced at the screen. His ears flattened for a moment before resetting. He read it for a second, then pocketed it without responding. Cody waited for an explanation. None came.

"Look," Cody muttered, "if walking with me is going to get you in trouble or something, you don't have to babysit. I can just, I don't know, hide in the trees until this blows over."

Lukas snorted. "You're not hiding in the trees." His tail flicked once. "You landed on a campus, not in a lab. You're a person, Cody, not an exhibit. I'm not letting anyone turn this into a project."

The word *lab* hooked into him. He almost tripped.

"I didn't say anything about a lab," Cody said, keeping his voice level.

"You didn't have to." Lukas's ears pressed back for a second, then relaxed. "You're jumpy, you don't know the rules here, and people in charge like to turn problems into paperwork. My job is to make sure you don't end up in anyone's file folder before you've had breakfast."

People in charge. Paperwork. Cody followed Lukas's glance and saw a tall brick building with wide glass doors and a metal sculpture of a double helix out front. It sat there against the gray sky like a threat, windows reflecting bare branches. A science building. Of course. He swallowed. "So your... dean, or whatever you have, they'd freak out about me?"

"Dean would want meetings," Lukas said carefully. "Committees. Words like *unprecedented* and *opportunity.*" His muzzle flattened on that last one. "You don't need any of that today. Today you need coffee and somewhere you can sit without an audience."

Lukas didn't dress it up or make promises. He simply refused to let it happen.

They rounded a corner and the dorm came into view. Five stories of old brick, older than some of the other buildings on campus. Narrow windows, the kind of ugly that said function over form. A row of evergreen bushes lined the foundation, half-hiding a side entrance. Somewhere above, a window was cracked open despite the cold, music drifting down too quiet to make out.

Lukas swiped a keycard, pushed the door open, and checked the hall before waving Cody in.

The sound changed first. Outside noise dropped to the quiet of old carpet and distant doors closing. The place smelled like dust, cleaner, and a mix of fur and laundry soap. Normal enough, if you didn't look too close at the bulletin board, where every smiling face on the flyers had some kind of muzzle.

Cody's heart rate finally started slowing down.

"Third floor," Lukas said. "No elevator, sorry." He pointed to an out-of-order sign on the elevator doors.

"Fine," Cody said. "I have legs."

He kept his eyes on his boots as they climbed, trying not to notice the four or five students who went quiet as he passed. He felt their stares anyway, prickling along his arms. Lukas blocked most of it, a solid wall on the outside of the stairs, making it hard for anyone to stop Cody or get a good look.

They reached a door with a beat-up Timberwood Badgers sticker stuck crooked near the handle. Lukas unlocked it and pushed it open.

The place was small but it worked. Open room that doubled as kitchen and living area. A counter ran along the left wall near the door, small sink at one end, dorm fridge underneath. Coffee maker sat on the counter next to a portable cooktop and microwave. Past that, the room opened into a living area: fold-out couch facing a TV on the opposite wall, maybe fifty inches, with an entertainment center underneath holding a couple gaming consoles. Desk to the left of the TV, gaming rig glowing on its surface, fan humming. Sturdy coffee table in the middle. Two doors at the far end of the right wall. Through the one that was half-open, Cody caught a glimpse of a bed, a shelf full of trophies, and a football on a stand. The bedroom. Down the hall came a burst of laughter, then a door slamming.

"Come in," Lukas said. "Door locks. No one barges in here but me."

*Safe.* The word bounced around Cody's head, looking for somewhere to stick.

He stepped inside. The carpet felt rough under his sneakers. He noticed the dirt on his jeans, the leaf bits stuck to his jacket from the forest floor. The thing was barely holding together anymore, threads coming loose at the cuffs, but it was all he had. A team jacket hung from a hook by the door. Jerseys were pinned to the wall above the couch. The whole place smelled like coffee grounds and something warm. The kind of smell that said someone actually lived here. He caught his reflection in the dark TV screen. Human face, too pale. Dark hair messed up and pushed back with his fingers. Eyes wide and shadowed from a semester of crappy sleep. He didn't belong here. He didn't really belong anywhere, but here he stuck out like a sore thumb.

"Sit," Lukas said. He pointed at the fold-out couch. "I'll make coffee."

The couch springs complained when Cody dropped onto it. A window on the far wall looked out over a slice of campus. Brick buildings, trees, a path where students laughed at something he couldn't hear. His pattern brain tried to read them through the glass. Tails and ears moved as they talked, adding layers to the body language he was used to. Posture still worked. The way someone leaned in or held back, the angle of their shoulders. That translated. But the ear positions, the tail movements, those were new variables. A fox's ears flattened as she talked to a friend. Fear? Annoyance? Submission? He couldn't tell yet.

*You'll figure it out,* he told himself. *You always do.*

He pressed his hands together between his knees until his knuckles hurt.

Behind him, Lukas moved like he'd done this a thousand times. Scoop grounds, fill water, flip a switch. The machine sputtered and hissed, filling the room with the smell of brewing coffee. Normal. Grounding. For a second, if Cody closed his eyes, he could almost pretend he was back at the community college café, nursing a too-bitter cup between classes and pretending that counted as having a future. Except he'd never had a six-and-a-half-foot wolf a few feet away, talking quiet so he wouldn't fall apart.

"You said coffee exists here," Cody heard himself say. "Phones, too."

"Coffee, phones, bills, exams," Lukas said. "Congratulations, you crossed dimensions and still landed somewhere that assigns homework. Sugar?"

"Black is fine."

Lukas brought over a chipped Timberwood Badgers mug and put it in his hands. The heat hit his fingers first, then his wrists, chasing out the cold from the woods. He took a sip. Strong and a little bitter, but real. Warmth went down his throat and loosened the tight knot in his chest, just a little.

Lukas opened the mini-fridge and pulled out a foil-covered container. "Noodles," he said, peeling back the lid. Steam curled up, carrying ginger and soy. "They're safe. Should be, anyway."

Cody's stomach growled before he could stop it. He hadn't eaten since... he couldn't remember. The library? That felt like a different lifetime.

Lukas handed him a fork and slid the container across the coffee table. "Eat. You look like you're running on fumes."

Cody didn't argue. He scooped up a forkful, blew on it once, and shoved it in his mouth.

The first second was fine. Ginger, soy, a little sesame. Normal.

Then his sinuses caught fire.

"What the..." He choked, eyes watering, tongue screaming. Heat exploded across his mouth and down his throat like he'd swallowed a lit match. He grabbed for the coffee, took a gulp, and made it worse. "Oh god, oh fuck..."

Lukas's ears flattened. "Shit." He was already moving, yanking the fridge open again. A carton of milk hit the coffee table. "Drink. Now."

Cody grabbed it with shaking hands and chugged. The cold cut through some of the burn, but his lips still felt like they were melting. He gasped, wiped his streaming eyes, and stared at the noodles like they'd personally betrayed him.

"What the hell was that?"

Lukas picked up the container and sniffed. His muzzle wrinkled. "Benji." He said the name like a curse. "Habanero mash. He sneaks it into stuff when nobody's looking." He set the container down, shaking his head. "Those were supposed to be mine. Little bastard."

Cody took another long drink of milk, breathing through his nose. The fire was fading to a dull roar. "Who's Benji?"

"Hedgehog. Lives down the hall. Thinks he's funny." Lukas slid the poisoned noodles away from Cody like they might bite again. "He and Thorne, big bear on the team with me, they're floormates. Benji's good people, but his idea of a joke is chemical warfare."

Cody's tongue felt like sandpaper. "Remind me to thank him later."

"I'll let him know his prank landed on the interdimensional visitor instead of me." Lukas almost smiled. "He'll either be horrified or proud. Fifty-fifty."

Cody finished the milk and set the carton down, still breathing a little hard. His mouth would probably taste like burning for the next hour. Great first impression on his new reality.

"You didn't cause a scene, by the way," Lukas said, leaning against the counter. "Not any more than a dragon sighting would. People talk, then they move on."

"Pretty sure being the human who popped out of nowhere isn't something this place is going to forget overnight," Cody muttered.

"By lunch, the version where you breathed fire will be more popular than the truth." Lukas shrugged. "Rumors are loud, but they're not organized. What matters is who writes reports."

Cody looked up. "Reports."

"Dean. Department heads." Lukas's eyes flicked briefly toward the window, toward that science building, then back. "If they hear about you the wrong way, they'll want meetings and scans and big words. So I'd rather they hear nothing for a while."

There it was again. That same steady refusal, without the drama or horror stories.

"And you can stop that?" Cody asked.

"I can make it harder for them." Lukas folded his arms loosely. "Keep you off main routes, tell anyone who asks that you're a visiting student from out of town until we have a better plan. It buys time."

Cody studied him. His pattern brain was working again, cataloging details. The wolf's shoulders were still relaxed, but there was something tight around his eyes he hadn't noticed outside. The way his ears kept twitching toward the door, toward sounds in the hall. The slight tension in his jaw when he mentioned the dean. He was worried. Not about Cody. About what helping Cody might cost him. He realized this wasn't nothing for Lukas. Helping some random human who fell out of nowhere. Lying to whoever ran this place. Picking side paths and side doors and watching buildings with double helix sculptures. The guy was sticking his neck out, and Cody could see the weight of it now, sitting on those big shoulders like a bag of rocks.

"Why?" Cody asked. The word came out before he could stop it. "Why help me? You don't know me. I could be anybody."

Lukas was quiet for a second. His tail moved once, a slow sweep.

"Because you needed help," he said. "And I was there."

Cody waited for more. A tragic backstory, a complicated motive, something that explained why a stranger would stick his neck out. But that was it. That was the whole answer.

He didn't know what to do with that.

Cody felt how tired he was before he admitted it to himself. Coffee had taken the edge off the panic, but once the adrenaline faded, everything underneath was just exhausted. Bone tired. Waiting-at-the-bus-stop-at-dawn tired. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose. "So what now?" he asked. "Do we just... wait until tomorrow and see if the universe spits me back out?"

Lukas's ears tilted a little, like he was thinking through answers and throwing most of them out. "Tomorrow is a problem for tomorrow," he said. "Right now you need sleep."

"Sleep," Cody echoed. "In the magical furry universe where I maybe don't exist on paper."

"Paper can wait." Lukas glanced at the dark window, then back at Cody. "You look like you've been running on coffee and stubbornness for days already. Portal didn't help."

That was way too accurate.

Cody looked around the room. One bed, clearly taken. Desk, couch. No spare mattress appeared just because he needed one.

"Sounds like a plan," he said after a second. "Where am I sleeping?"

"Couch folds out," Lukas said. He nudged the ottoman with his paw and the top shifted, hinges clicking. "Sheets are inside. Blanket's clean, I promise." He nodded toward the two doors on the right wall. "Half bath on the left if you need it. Bedroom's on the right. Communal showers are down the hall if you want a real rinse, but that can wait till morning."

Cody pushed himself up from the couch. His legs felt like wet noodles. "Wake you if the walls start breathing, got it."

"Wake me if that happens for real," Lukas said. Something in his face softened. "Or if you need anything else."

Cody paused. "Walls breathe here?"

Lukas kept a straight face. "Only after my friend Benji's ramen. Otherwise they behave."

A tired laugh came out before Cody could stop it. Thinner than he wanted, but real.

Lukas clicked off the small kitchen light, leaving just the desk lamp and the dim light from the window. The room got smaller in a way that wasn't bad. Less space to get lost in.

"Get the bed set up," Lukas said. "I'm gonna hit the showers down the hall. I'll keep my door cracked when I get back. Holler if the furniture gets chatty."

Cody opened the ottoman. A folded sheet and a mismatched pillow sat inside, smelling like laundry soap and dust. He wrestled the couch into its new shape. The metal frame unfolded with the same complaint fold-out couches always make. Turns out interdimensional travel didn't improve couch design. He stripped off his jacket and draped it over the arm, then kicked off his shoes and socks. Cold air bit at his bare feet. Without his layers, he felt smaller. More like a kid crashing at a friend's place after missing the last bus. The pipes ticked in the walls. From down the hall, the faint hiss of water. Normal sounds.

He made the bed as best he could, corners more of a suggestion than anything, then sat down to test the mattress. Thin, but softer than his own at home, which had a permanent dip where his body had given up years ago.

The main door clicked open. Lukas walked in with a towel over his shoulder, fur a little damp. He wore shorts and a soft T-shirt now, smelling like soap, clean and sharp under the usual pine. He crossed to the bedroom door and pushed it open, then turned back.

He looked over Cody's handiwork on the fold-out. "It'll hold," he decided. "If it doesn't, you've got bigger problems than the dean."

Cody huffed. "Comforting."

"It's meant to be." Lukas's mouth twitched. He tipped his head toward the light switch. "I'm killing the lamp. You good?"

Cody nodded, then realized the wolf could probably see better in the dark than he could. "Yeah. I'm fine."

The lamp snapped off. For a second, Cody couldn't see anything. Then shapes came back: the rectangle of the window, the glow of the TV's standby light, Lukas's silhouette crossing toward the bedroom. The door pulled mostly closed, leaving just a crack of darkness. From past that crack, springs creaked as the wolf lay down. The room was quiet. Just the mini-fridge cycling, wind against the glass, distant door latches from somewhere else on the floor. No TV blaring, no sports channel filling the silence. No heavy, uneven snoring from behind a bedroom door, thick with bourbon and wasted time.

"Hey, uh," Cody said into the dark. His voice sounded smaller without anything to bounce off but the ceiling. "Lukas?"

Something moved in the bedroom. An ear probably perked up, though Cody couldn't see through the crack.

"Yeah?"

"Thanks." The word felt clumsy, too light for everything wrapped around it: the coffee, the shield in the crowd, the fact that nobody here had told him he was being dramatic or ungrateful. "For all of this."

A small pause. Cody could almost hear the wolf breathing.

"Anytime," Lukas said. No bravado, no joke on top.

Just that.

Past the cracked bedroom door, the mattress creaked. Blanket shifted. Then nothing. Cody lay back and stared at a ceiling he could barely see. He could make out shapes in the dark: the TV, the desk with its sleeping computer, the little green power light on the entertainment center. He let his mind wander because trying to pin it down never worked.

Could he just... live here? The thought showed up uninvited. This place had cell service and coffee makers and annoying friends with weaponized ramen. People threw around words like *dean* and *biology department*, and that should've scared him more, but it sat weird next to the image of his dad half-slid off the recliner, bourbon bottles on the carpet like they'd lost a fight.

Back there he was the kid from the wrong end of town with a bad incident in his past and a GPA that didn't impress anyone. A liberal arts major with a bus pass and a degree he could already feel sagging in his hands. Home was mildew and trash bags and stale booze, and the sound of his father cursing at late-night reruns.

Here he was the Human. Capital H. Everyone stared, but at least they saw him.

And Lukas. Patient, solid Lukas, who moved like a starting linebacker and watched people like they were plays on a field. Cody could admit, just to himself, that the wolf was stupidly good-looking: black fur, those amber eyes, that scent that meant woods and cool air and something steady underneath. The kind of guy who probably had everyone on campus orbiting him without even trying.

*Whole different planet, Guiles. Literally.*

His brain did that thing where it runs in circles until it gets tired of itself. Thoughts got blurry, words stopped making sense. The day's weight pushed him deeper into the thin mattress. Every muscle that had been braced for the next bad thing since he woke up in the woods finally started to let go. His breathing slowed down. Somewhere on the other side of the room, springs creaked once as Lukas shifted, then went quiet. Cody's eyes closed. Last thing he thought before he passed out: for the first time in forever, if he yelled in the dark, somebody might actually give a damn.
