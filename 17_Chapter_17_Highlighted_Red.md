# Chapter 17: Highlighted Red

The October sun sat low and weak behind a sheet of clouds, throwing everything into that flat overcast light that made noon look like dusk. Cody's jacket, the charcoal canvas with the Timberwood crest, wasn't quite thick enough for the chill, but he didn't say anything. His legs still felt loose from the tunnel, muscles warm from throwing, and the cold air was almost welcome against his skin.

Lukas walked half a step ahead, scanning the path like he always did. Habit, probably. Or instinct. Hard to tell the difference with him.

They cut through a gap in the chain-link fence and onto the main path that wound toward the quad. Students passed in clusters, bundled in scarves and hoodies, breath fogging as they talked. A pair of rabbits in matching beanies. A squirrel darting between legs with an armful of acorns. Nobody looked twice at Cody. Four days ago, every set of eyes felt like a spotlight. Now he was just another shape moving across campus.

Lukas pulled out his phone, thumbs moving across the screen as he walked.

"Checking in with Gem," he said. "Seeing where she's at."

The phone buzzed a moment later. Lukas glanced at the screen and slipped it back in his pocket without showing Cody what it said.

*Checking in. Or checking up.*

Cody filed it away with everything else. The way Lukas always seemed to know where the pack was. The way he steered conversations, steered routes, steered everything without ever making it look like steering. Maybe that was just how packs worked. Maybe that was just Lukas being Lukas.

Or maybe Cody was being tracked, and Lukas was making sure Gem knew their location.

He shook the thought loose. Paranoid. He was being paranoid.

Near the row of evergreens that bordered the quad, a badger in a maintenance vest stood by a utility box, clipboard in hand. He looked up as they passed, eyes tracking them for a beat too long, then jotted something on his clipboard and went back to whatever he was pretending to work on.

Cody noticed. How the badger's pen moved too deliberately. How he didn't look at the utility box once.

*Probably nothing.*

But the thought felt automatic. Something he told himself because the alternative was too exhausting to consider. He was tired of seeing threats everywhere. Tired of that low hum of paranoia that had followed him since the portal. Maybe maintenance workers really did stand around with clipboards and watch students walk by. Maybe that was just how things worked here.

He didn't look back.

"Hungry?" Lukas asked.

"Getting there."

"Student Union's past the trees. Food's not bad. Better than the dorm vending machines, anyway."

They pushed through the gap in the evergreens, and the building rose ahead of them. Bigger than Cody expected. Wide brick facade, glass doors, students streaming in and out in a steady rhythm. A banner hung between two windows: GO BADGERS in forest green letters, the mascot snarling underneath.

Lukas pulled the door open.

The noise hit first. Conversations layered over each other, bouncing off the high ceilings. The clatter of trays against the long tables that ran down the center of the room, their attached benches scuffed and worn from years of use. Chairs scraping against tile. Somewhere, a burst of laughter that sounded more like a bark.

Then the warmth, wrapping around him like stepping into someone else's kitchen. The smell came with it. Not breakfast anymore. Grease from the grill, something with onions, the earthy sweetness of tomato soup. Steam rose from the food stations along the far wall, where students shuffled past with plastic trays.

The cafeteria took up most of the first floor, but it wasn't just tables and food lines. Near the windows, smaller round tables with mismatched chairs clustered together, students hunched over laptops or picking at salads. A row of vending machines hummed against one wall, a raccoon feeding coins into one while a fox waited behind him, arms crossed. Beyond the tables, a lounge area sprawled around a flatscreen TV mounted to the wall, some nature documentary playing with the sound off. A group of wolves had claimed the overstuffed couches, sprawled out like they owned the place. In the corner, an old arcade cabinet blinked and chirped to itself, ignored by everyone except a rabbit who kept glancing at it like he was working up the nerve to play.

Cody stood in the doorway, taking it in. The size of it. The noise. Wolves and foxes and bears and rabbits, all of them eating lunch, checking phones, arguing over nothing. Fur and feathers everywhere he looked. A moose with antlers that barely cleared the ceiling. A pair of otters sharing a plate of fish. A massive bear lumbering past with a tray stacked high enough to feed three people.

Four days ago, he'd been on the other side of a portal, eating gas station food in a dead-end town. Now he was standing in a college cafeteria full of talking animals, and somehow that was starting to feel normal.

"Grab a tray," Lukas said, already moving toward the food line. "Soup's usually safe. Skip the fish."

Cody grabbed a tray from the stack and followed. The line shuffled forward, students loading plates with varying degrees of enthusiasm. A wolf ahead of him was building a sandwich that could've used structural support, layers of meat and cheese stacked so high the bread looked like an afterthought. Cody waited his turn, watching the options pass. Turkey, roast beef, something that might have been ham. A vat of soup with a ladle sticking out.

"Turkey's decent," Lukas said over his shoulder. He was already at the sandwich station, hands moving with the efficiency of someone who'd done this a hundred times. "Roast beef's hit or miss. Soup's tomato today. You want coffee?"

"Sure."

Cody reached for the tongs.

By the time he got to the station, the sandwich was already made. Turkey, cheese, lettuce, no tomato. Sitting on a plate next to a bowl of soup that Lukas must have ladled while Cody was still three people back in line.

Cody looked at the plate. Looked at Lukas.

"You already made mine?"

"Faster this way." Lukas grabbed two coffees from the dispenser, steam curling up from the paper cups. "Line gets long after noon. Come on, I know a spot."

He was already moving toward the far corner of the cafeteria, weaving between tables with his tray balanced on one massive paw. Cody picked up his own tray, his lunch already assembled, already decided, and followed.

The turkey looked fine. The soup smelled fine. Everything was fine.

But something prickled at the back of his neck. That same feeling from the tunnel. From the jacket. From every moment since he'd landed in this world where someone else made the call and he just went along with it.

*He didn't even ask what I wanted.*

Not what kind of sandwich. Not if he liked tomatoes. Not if he wanted soup at all. Lukas had just... decided. The tunnel. The jacket. Everything.

Cody's grip tightened on the tray.

*He's helping. He's been helping since day one. This is what helping looks like.*

But another voice, quieter, colder, whispered: *Is it? Or is this what control looks like when it's wearing a friendly face?*

He pushed the thought down. But it didn't go quietly.

They ended up in a corner booth, partially hidden by a support column. Backs to the wall, clear view of the room. Lukas set his tray down and slid in, eyes doing a quick sweep of the cafeteria before settling on Cody. Even here, in a room full of students eating lunch, he was watching. Always watching.

*Protecting you,* Cody told himself. *He's protecting you.*

*Or keeping tabs.*

He sat across from Lukas and picked up his spoon. The soup was warm and filling, maybe a little too much basil. The sandwich was fine. Turkey, cheese, no surprises. Exactly what Lukas would have picked for himself.

Cody ate without tasting much.

Silence settled between them. The cafeteria noise filled the space, conversations rising and falling around them. A table of foxes near the windows burst into laughter at something on someone's phone. Two finches shared a bowl of seeds, pecking in synchronized rhythm.

"So," Lukas said, setting down his sandwich. "What were you studying? Back home."

The question landed somewhere between casual and pointed. Cody chewed, swallowed, bought himself a second.

He could tell the truth. English major, creative writing focus. But that felt like handing over a piece of himself he wasn't ready to give.

"Journalism," he said.

Lukas's ears tilted forward. "Yeah? You wanted to be a reporter?"

"Something like that. Asking questions. Figuring out what's really going on." Cody shrugged. "I like knowing how things work. Why people do what they do."

It wasn't entirely a lie. He'd taken a few journalism classes. Liked the structure of it, the way you had to find the truth underneath the surface. That part was real.

"Makes sense," Lukas said. "You've got that look. Like you're always watching, putting pieces together."

"That obvious?"

"Little bit." Lukas picked up his sandwich, took a bite, chewed thoughtfully. His tail flicked once under the table. "What year were you?"

"Sophomore. Would've been a junior next fall."

"Middle name?"

Cody paused, spoon halfway to his mouth. "Why?"

Lukas shrugged, tearing off another bite of sandwich like the question meant nothing. "Just curious."

"Dante. Cody Dante Guiles." He set the spoon down. "You building a dossier on me or something?"

Lukas's eyes flicked up, met his, held for a beat. Then he smiled, just a little, one corner of his muzzle lifting. "Just making conversation."

But there was more underneath. A purpose he couldn't quite name. Like Lukas was gathering pieces for what wasn't yet visible.

"What about you?" Cody asked, steering the conversation sideways. "Football's not forever. What's the plan after?"

Lukas set down what was left of his sandwich, wiped his muzzle with a napkin. For a second, something shifted in his expression. Softer, more open. Like Cody had asked a question that actually mattered.

"Physical therapy. Maybe coaching eventually." He leaned back against the booth, shoulders relaxing. "Help guys come back from injuries, keep them on the field."

"That's actually really good."

"Don't sound so surprised." But Lukas's tail wagged once, quick and involuntary, before he caught it. He looked away, cleared his throat. "Saw too many teammates blow out a knee and lose everything. Figured somebody should know how to put them back together."

Cody watched him. Lukas looking at his empty plate instead of meeting his eyes. His paw curling around his coffee cup like he needed something to hold onto.

*He actually cares about this. This isn't just small talk.*

"I'm not surprised," Cody said, quieter. "I just... didn't expect it."

"Expected what? Dumb jock, no plans past the season?"

"No. I just..." Cody searched for the words. "You seem like the type who lives in the moment."

"Maybe." Lukas pushed his empty plate aside. "But moments end. Gotta have something waiting when they do."

He said it casually, but there was weight underneath. Cody thought about the tunnel. Lukas checking his pulse after the too-heavy words. Always checking. Always watching for the thing that might break.

Lukas stood, stacking his tray. "Come on. We need to get you an ID."

The words landed heavy and sudden. Cody blinked. "Wait, what?"

"Campus ID. Gets you into buildings, lets you audit classes, makes you official." Lukas was already moving toward the tray return. "Gem's in Special Collections. She texted back, she's there all afternoon."

"Hold on." Cody stood, but Lukas was three steps ahead, sliding his tray onto the return belt. "Lukas. Wait."

Lukas turned, one ear swiveling back. "What?"

"You want to tell me what we're doing? Or am I just following?"

The words came out sharper than he'd intended. But he didn't take them back.

Something flickered in Lukas's expression. He glanced around the cafeteria. Students still eating, still talking, nobody paying attention to the wolf and the human standing by the tray return.

"Not here," Lukas said, voice lower. "Outside."

He headed for the door. And Cody, after a beat, followed.

Because that's what he did. He followed.

At least for now.

---

The quad stretched gray and quiet under the pale October sky. Brown grass, bare oaks, brick paths dark with old moisture. A few students crossed in the distance, heads down against the chill.

Lukas stopped near the fountain. Drained for the season, the stone basin empty, the wolf-head spout dry. He sat on the rim, the cold seeping through his jeans, and looked up at Cody. "Okay. I'm listening."

Cody stood there for a moment, hands shoved in his pockets. His knuckles ached. "Being in the system means being trackable," he said. "Right now I'm a ghost. Nobody knows I exist. If I want to disappear, I can."

"And what happens when someone decides you're inconvenient?"

Cody's hands curled into fists inside his pockets. "What do you mean?"

"A ghost is easy to erase." Lukas leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "No records. No paper trail. One day you're walking across the quad, next day you're gone, and nobody even knows to ask questions." His voice was steady, but his eyes were serious. "A registered student has a file. Has a schedule. Has people who notice when they don't show up to class."

"So I'm supposed to trust the system?" Cody's voice came out harder than he'd intended.

"You're supposed to trust that the system has rules. And rules leave trails."

Cody kicked at a dead leaf on the path. "And if the wrong person has access to those trails?"

"Then at least there's a record." Lukas held his gaze. "Look, I get it. Being visible feels like being vulnerable. But invisible is worse. Invisible means nobody notices when you're gone."

Cody didn't answer. Invisibility had been his armor for years. At school, in his neighborhood, at home when his father was drinking. You learned not to be seen. Not to be noticed. Not to give anyone a reason to look twice. And it had worked. He was still here. But "still here" meant something different now. Still here meant a world where people had claws and fangs and the dean of students had offered him a deal that felt more like a leash.

*Protection,* Lukas kept saying. *Paper trails. Accountability.* But Graves had said something similar, hadn't he? *I can help you.* Different words, same shape. And Cody couldn't shake the feeling that Lukas's logic sounded a little too convenient. A registered student was harder to disappear, sure. But a registered student was also easier to find. Easier to watch. Easier to control. *Who benefits from me being in the system?*

He thought about the note in his pocket. The office with the candy bowl and the family photos. The door that was still open. If he was in the system, Graves could track him. Watch his movements. Know exactly where he was at any given moment. But if he was a ghost, Graves could make him vanish without anyone ever knowing he'd existed. Two risks. Different shapes. Same teeth. And Lukas didn't know about any of it. Cody had kept that door closed, hadn't mentioned the meeting, hadn't told anyone about Office 412. He wanted to tell him. Knew he should. But the part of him that had been turning Graves's words over since this morning wasn't ready to close that door yet. He let it go.

Lukas let out a slow breath. "I'm not trying to control you." The words pulled Cody back. Lukas was looking at him differently now. Ears flat, shoulders hunched forward. "I know I... I do that. Make decisions without asking. Move before you've had time to think. Gem told me I need to stop. That you're not a project I'm managing, you're a person." He exhaled. "She's right. I'm working on it."

Cody sat down on the fountain rim. The stone was hard beneath him, but he didn't move.

"The ID thing," Lukas said. "It's not about control. It's about making sure you can't just vanish. Administration has rules. They have to follow procedures. If a registered student goes missing, there are forms, investigations, people asking questions. If a ghost disappears?" He shrugged. "Nobody even knows to look."

Cody turned it over in his head. The logic was sound. A name in the system meant accountability. Meant someone would notice if he stopped showing up. Meant the dean couldn't just make him disappear without leaving a trail. But it also meant visibility. A target on his back. A name in a database that the wrong person could find. He'd already weighed these risks. But hearing Lukas lay it out, hearing someone else say it, loosened something. Made the math clearer. Cody stared at the dry fountain, at the wolf-head spout frozen mid-howl. Then he nodded. "Okay."

Lukas looked up. "Okay?"

"The ID. We do it." Cody held his gaze. "But I need you to understand something. This is my choice. I'm not doing it because you told me to. I'm doing it because the math works out."

Lukas nodded slowly. "Fair."

"And next time you want to make a decision that affects my life, you ask first. Deal?"

Lukas's shoulders dropped. Relief, maybe. Or something close to it. "Deal."

They sat there for a moment, the empty fountain between them, the cold pressing in. Then Lukas stood and offered a paw. "Come on. Gem's waiting."

Cody took it and let himself be pulled to his feet. They started walking.

---

The library rose at the far end of the quad like something that had been there before the rest of campus existed. Gray stone and weathered brick, three stories of gothic arches and narrow windows. A clock tower climbed from one corner, its face yellowed with age. Gargoyles crouched at the roofline, worn smooth by decades of rain. Stone badgers flanked the main entrance, seated on their haunches with books in their laps. Scholars, Cody thought. Or guards. Hard to tell the difference.

Lukas pulled the heavy door open, and the smell hit first. Old paper, dust, the particular mustiness of books that had been sitting in the same place for longer than anyone could remember. The vestibule swallowed the cold air behind them, and suddenly everything was warm and quiet.

The main floor stretched ahead, vaulted ceiling rising overhead, thick wooden beams crossing like ribs. Tall windows filtered the weak afternoon light. Reading tables dotted the space, green-shaded lamps casting pools of warm light. A few students sat scattered among them, heads bent over books. A raccoon in thick glasses. A deer with antlers that nearly scraped the ceiling when he stood. The circulation desk sat at the center, massive and dark, manned by an owl who looked like she'd been fighting sleep since the library opened. A wall clock ticked above her head, each second landing with a soft click.

"Elevator's this way." Lukas nodded toward the back.

The stacks swallowed them, shelves towering overhead, spines cracked and faded. The smell got thicker the deeper they went. Paper and leather and something older underneath, like the building itself was breathing.

The elevator waited at the back, hidden behind a shelf of oversized atlases. Brass gate, accordion door, the kind of thing you'd see in an old black-and-white movie. Lukas pulled the gate open with a clang that echoed too loud in the quiet. They stepped in. The space was cramped, barely big enough for both of them, and Lukas's shoulders brushed the walls on either side. He pulled the gate shut and pressed a button that had been worn smooth by decades of fingers.

The mechanism groaned. Cables creaked somewhere above them. The floor lurched, and they began to descend.

The light changed as they dropped. Warmer, dimmer, the fluorescent brightness of the main floor giving way to amber warmth. By the time the elevator shuddered to a stop, the air had thickened, heavy with dust and the particular silence of rooms that didn't get many visitors.

Lukas pushed the gate open, and Special Collections spread out before them. Low ceiling, low enough that Lukas had to duck his ears as he stepped out. The walls were lined with glass-fronted cases, old books and strange artifacts visible behind the panes. Wooden card catalogs with tarnished brass handles. Converted gas lamps that flickered like they remembered flame. And in the back corner, behind a heavy wooden table surrounded by folios and tomes, sat Gem.

Her ears perked as they approached. Amber eyes flicked up from the document she was studying, the mechanical pencil behind her ear catching the lamplight. She looked at Lukas first, then at Cody, and something in her expression softened slightly. "Still breathing," she said. "Both of you. That's progress."

The words landed differently than they might have yesterday. Cody caught the way her eyes moved between them, assessing. She knew something had happened. Of course she did. She was the one who'd told Lukas to stop treating him like a project.

"Good to see you too." Lukas stopped at the edge of her table, paws shoved in his pockets. "Need a favor."

Gem leaned back, tail flicking. "You have that look. The one that usually means I'm about to regret answering my phone."

"Campus ID. Photo, name, barcode that scans."

"You're asking me to forge federal documents." Gem's ears flattened. "In the middle of a Tuesday afternoon. In a university basement."

"Can you do it or not?"

"I don't know, Lukas. I've never done it before." She pulled open a drawer and started rummaging. "But I've seen the templates. I know where the blank card stock is. And I'm reasonably confident I can make the barcode work." She pulled out a small camera, then a stack of blank cards, then a portable printer that looked like it had been liberated from the registrar's office. "No promises on the laminator. I borrowed it from the geology lab and I'm not entirely sure it still works."

Cody watched her gather the equipment. No practiced movements. No smooth routine. She was figuring this out as she went, pulling pieces together from different places, making it work because she was smart enough to improvise.

"Why?" Gem asked, setting the camera on the table. Her eyes found Cody's. Direct. Sharp. "Why does the human from another world need a campus ID badly enough for me to risk getting expelled?"

Cody opened his mouth. Closed it.

"Protection," Lukas said. "Paper trail. If he's in the system, he's harder to disappear."

"I wasn't asking you." Gem's pencil started tapping. "I was asking him."

The basement went quiet. Just the flicker of the gas lamps and the distant creak of the building settling. Cody thought about lying. About deflecting. About letting Lukas answer for him the way Lukas had been answering for him since he got here. But Gem had told Lukas to stop treating him like a project. She deserved honesty.

"It was his idea," Cody said, nodding toward Lukas. "But the logic makes sense. A ghost is easy to erase. A name in the system means someone notices if I disappear." He paused. "And I'm tired of other people making decisions for me. This one I'm choosing."

Gem's tapping stopped. Her ears swiveled forward, and for a long moment she just looked at him. Then the corner of her mouth twitched. "Good answer." She turned to Lukas. "See? He can think for himself. Like I told you."

Lukas's tail tucked slightly. He didn't argue.

"Stand over there." Gem pointed at the filing cabinets along the back wall. "Try to look like you've slept in the last week."

Cody walked over and positioned himself against the cabinets. Cold metal at his back, the smell of old paper all around him. He straightened his collar, tried to relax his shoulders.

Gem raised the camera. "Full name?"

Lukas opened his mouth.

"I can answer for myself," Cody said again. Quieter this time. Not angry. Just certain.

Gem's eyebrow rose. Lukas's jaw clicked shut.

"Cody Guiles." He paused. "But I'm guessing you don't want my real name on the card."

"Smart human." Gem lowered the camera. "Pick something. Something common. Something nobody's going to remember five minutes after they check your ID."

Cody thought about it. Not Otterton. Not some clever reference that would make Lukas feel like he'd contributed. Something boring. Something invisible. "Miller," he said. "Cody Miller."

"Major?"

"Journalism."

Gem typed it into her laptop, keys clicking in the quiet. "Year?"

"Sophomore."

She nodded, still typing. "Okay, Cody Miller. Journalism major. Sophomore. Look at the camera and try not to look like you're about to commit a felony."

He managed something that was probably closer to a grimace. Flash. He blinked against the afterimage, purple spots swimming in his vision.

Gem checked the screen. "You look like a student. Confused, slightly lost, definitely hasn't slept enough." She shrugged. "Perfect."

She fed the image into the laptop, connected the printer, and held her breath as the machine whirred to life. A card slid out, still warm. She ran it through the laminator twice, checked the barcode with her phone, and nodded once. "It'll scan. Probably. Don't use it anywhere with a live database check." She held up the card, studied it, then tossed it to Cody.

He caught it. His face stared back at him from the plastic. Cody Miller. Journalism. Sophomore. A person who had never existed until thirty seconds ago. He turned the card over in his hands. The plastic was still warm. The photo looked like him but didn't feel like him. Or maybe it felt more like him than the old one ever had.

*You're in the system now.* The thought should have felt like victory. Safety. A paper trail that meant someone would notice if he disappeared. But Graves's voice was still there, somewhere in the back of his head. *My door is open. If you want answers, real answers, not filtered through people who've already decided what's best for you...* The dean had offered protection too. Different words, different shape, but the same promise underneath. And now Cody had put himself in a system that Graves could access. Could track. Could use. Was this safety? Or had he just made himself easier to find?

"You okay?" Lukas's voice, soft.

Cody looked up. Both of them were watching him. Gem with her head tilted, pencil tapping. Lukas with that worried crease between his eyes. "Yeah." He slipped the card into his pocket. His fingers brushed paper, the note still there, still waiting. He pulled his hand out quickly. "Just thinking."

"Dangerous habit." Gem was already turning back to her laptop. "Don't make a career of it."

"Thanks, Gem." Lukas tilted his head toward the elevator. Not a push this time. An invitation.

They stepped into the elevator. The gate clanged shut. The mechanism groaned, and they began to rise.

Cody glanced back through the brass bars. Gem was already turning back to her desk, pulling a stack of documents toward her. But instinct made him keep watching. She stopped. Her eyes had found her monitor, and her expression shifted. Her tail, which had been flicking absently, went still. The elevator climbed. The basement fell away. And Cody lost sight of her face before he could read what was on it.

---

Gem stared at the screen.

The registration she'd just processed was highlighted red. A flag she hadn't put there.

DENIED — ADMIN HOLD — REF: OFFICE 412

Her pencil stopped tapping.

Office 412. That was Graves. Dean Victor Graves, who never flagged student registrations, who never touched the system directly, who operated through channels and committees and plausible deniability. Until now.

She pulled up the reference file. Empty. No notes, no reason for the hold, no explanation. Just the flag itself, blinking red like a warning. Or a claim.

Gem leaned back in her chair. Her tail curled around her legs, tight and still. She didn't call after them. Didn't send a message. Not yet.

First, she needed to understand what she was looking at.

She opened a new search window and started digging.
