# Chapter 18: Office 412

The admin building. Fourth floor, corner office. Morning light cut through the floor-to-ceiling glass, throwing long shadows across the mahogany desk. The campus spread out below like a model someone had built to scale. The quad. The library. The science building at the far edge, its windows dark even now.

The chair faced the window. It usually did.

Victor Graves watched a pair of students cross the quad, backpacks bouncing, breath fogging in the cold. They walked close enough that their shoulders touched. Young. Careless. No idea what moved beneath the surface of their little world. His claws tapped the armrest once. Twice. A rhythm he'd developed decades ago, back when he still believed patience was a virtue instead of a necessity. The plain white mug sat at his elbow, coffee gone cold an hour ago. The "World's Okayest Dean" mug stayed in its drawer. No audience today.

Three knocks at the door.

"Enter."

The badger stepped inside. Security uniform pressed, clipboard in hand, eyes fixed somewhere around Graves's desk instead of his face. Good. The ones who made eye contact were the ones who thought they mattered.

"Sir. The human. We have eyes on him."

"I'm aware." Graves didn't turn. The window held more interest than the badger's nervous shuffling. "What's the status?"

"Spotted him leaving the library basement yesterday with Raines. Lost visual when they cut through the maintenance tunnels. Picked him up again near the athletic center this morning, then nothing." The badger consulted his clipboard like it held answers instead of questions. "Raines is keeping him moving. Using back routes, service corridors. Avoiding the main paths."

"He knows where the cameras are."

"Yes, sir. He's been here long enough to learn them."

"Raines." The name sat in the air between them. Graves let it sit. "The linebacker."

"Yes, sir. Lukas Raines. Junior. Starting lineup. His room's been flagged, but we can't move on student housing without cause. The RA would ask questions."

"Questions have answers. That's not a problem." Graves's claws stilled on the armrest. "The problem is timing. The human needs to be contained before Friday."

"The game, sir?"

"The game." Graves watched a crow land on the science building's roof, black against gray stone. "Fifteen thousand people in the stadium. Cameras everywhere. Donors. Parents. If our guest decides to walk onto that field in front of the crowd, it becomes a very different conversation. One I'd prefer to avoid."

The badger scribbled something. His pen scratched loud in the quiet office.

"Double the patrols near the athletic facilities. I want someone on Raines's schedule at all times. Practice, classes, meals. Where he goes, eyes follow." Graves paused. "Discreetly. The wolf is suspicious enough already. If he thinks we're closing in, he'll find somewhere we can't reach."

"Yes, sir."

"And send for Kashtar."

The pen stopped. "Sir?"

"Rumi Kashtar. Football team. The bull." Graves's voice stayed soft, the way it always did. "He should be finishing his morning workout about now. Have him here within the hour."

The badger hesitated. Graves could feel it without looking. The question forming, the doubt. Whether this was wise. Whether involving a student athlete in whatever this was crossed some line the badger still believed existed. The hesitation passed. It always did.

"Yes, sir."

The door clicked shut. Silence settled back over the office like dust on an old photograph.

Graves reached for his coffee, remembered it was cold, and set it back down. The mug left no ring on the desk. Nothing in this office left marks. He'd made sure of that years ago. Through the glass, the campus continued its morning routine. Classes starting. Students shuffling between buildings. The machine grinding forward, indifferent to the small dramas playing out in its gears.

Somewhere down there, a human was hiding. Breathing air that didn't belong to him. Walking on ground he had no right to touch.

Fourteen years Graves had waited. Fourteen years since TH-2010-003 expired in transit, taking with it any hope of meaningful data. Fourteen years of budget meetings and alumni dinners and watching younger researchers publish papers on subjects they barely understood. This one was different. This one was alive. Healthy. Ambulatory. Walking around like it belonged here. The preliminary observations alone suggested cellular adaptation unlike anything in the literature. If he could just get his hands on it.

His claws curled into the leather armrest. The material creaked, soft as a sigh.

Patience. The subject wasn't going anywhere. Raines thought he was protecting something precious, but all he'd done was delay the inevitable. The wolf was emotional, impulsive, too wrapped up in whatever attachment he'd formed to see the larger picture. That was useful. Emotions made people predictable.

A knock. Heavy this time. Different rhythm.

"Enter."

The door swung open and the frame filled with muscle. Rumi Kashtar stood in the doorway, arms crossed over a chest that strained against his workout shirt. Nose ring catching the light. Dark eyes that couldn't quite hide the hunger underneath the suspicion.

Graves let him wait. Five seconds. Ten. Long enough for the silence to become uncomfortable.

Then he turned his chair. The movement was unhurried. The leather barely whispered as he pivoted to face his guest for the first time. His expression softened into something that looked almost like warmth.

"Rumi." The name landed easy, familiar. "Thank you for coming. I know your schedule is demanding this time of year. Please, sit. Make yourself comfortable."

"Security guy said you wanted to see me." Rumi's voice was a rumble, the kind that came from a chest built for intimidation. "Didn't say why."

"No, he wouldn't have. I wanted to speak with you personally." Graves gestured to the chair across from him with an open paw. "Can I get you anything? Water? Coffee? I have some of those protein bars the athletic department swears by, if you're hungry."

Rumi didn't move.

Graves let the offer hang for a moment, then nodded like he understood completely. "Straight to business. I respect that." He leaned forward, elbows on the desk, paws folded. The posture of a man sharing a confidence. "I've been watching you, Rumi. On the field. In practice. You have something special. Raw talent that doesn't come along very often."

Something shifted in Rumi's stance. Not much. Just a loosening of the shoulders.

"Coach Henderson mentions you in his reports. Says you work harder than anyone on the team. First one in, last one out." Graves shook his head slowly, a hint of sadness in his voice. "It's a shame, really. All that dedication, and somehow you keep getting passed over. Raines gets the spotlight. Raines gets the scouts' attention. And you're left wondering what you have to do to get noticed."

Rumi went still. His arms stayed crossed, but his weight shifted forward. Listening now.

"I know that feeling." Graves's voice dropped, intimate. "I was young once, believe it or not. Talented. Ambitious. Watching lesser people get opportunities I'd earned." He spread his paws. "It's not fair. But the world rarely is. The question is what you do about it."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I'd like to help you, Rumi. I see potential that's being wasted, and that bothers me." Graves reached for the candy bowl on his desk, took one of the wrapped chocolates, and held it out. An offering. "There's a situation on campus. Something delicate. And I think you might be uniquely positioned to assist."

Rumi didn't take the candy. "What kind of situation?"

"There's a young man. A human. You may have noticed him around Lukas." Graves set the chocolate down, unbothered by the rejection. "He's in trouble, Rumi. The kind of trouble that could hurt a lot of people if it's not handled carefully. Including Lukas."

That got a reaction. A flicker of something in Rumi's eyes. Not concern, exactly. But interest.

"Lukas thinks he's protecting this young man by hiding him. But he's not. He's putting himself at risk. His scholarship. His future. Everything he's worked for." Graves shook his head again, the picture of paternal worry. "I've tried to reach out, but Lukas and I... well. He doesn't trust easily. You know that better than anyone."

Rumi's expression shifted. Recognition, maybe. Or just the memory of a friendship that used to mean something.

"I need someone Lukas trusts. Someone who can keep an eye on the situation. Make sure things don't spiral out of control." Graves met Rumi's eyes, steady and warm. "And in return, I'd like to make sure your hard work finally gets the recognition it deserves. Full scholarship. Starting position. A real shot at the future you've earned."

The bull was quiet for a long moment. His chest rose and fell, slow and heavy.

"You want me to spy on Lukas."

"I want you to help me protect him from himself." Graves's voice stayed gentle. Understanding. "Lukas is emotional. He makes decisions with his heart instead of his head. That's admirable in some ways, but it's also dangerous. He's going to get hurt if someone doesn't intervene. I'm just asking you to be that someone."

Rumi's arms uncrossed. His hands hung at his sides, fingers flexing like he was working through a problem he couldn't quite solve.

"And if I say no?"

"Then you walk out that door and we never had this conversation. No hard feelings. No consequences." Graves spread his paws, palms up. Nothing to hide. "I'm not here to threaten you, Rumi. I'm here to offer you an opportunity. What you do with it is entirely up to you."

The silence stretched.

Then Rumi's shoulders dropped, just slightly. The resistance going out of him, replaced by something that looked almost like relief. Like he'd been waiting for permission to do what he'd wanted to do all along.

"What do you need from me?"

Graves smiled. It looked warm. It looked kind. It looked like exactly the right response to a young man making a difficult choice.

"Just stay close to Lukas. Let me know where he goes, who he talks to. If the human surfaces, I need to know immediately. That's all." He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a card. Plain white. A phone number printed in simple black text. "My direct line. Use it anytime, day or night. You're not alone in this, Rumi. I want you to know that."

Rumi took the card. Turned it over once. Slipped it into his pocket. "Yeah. Okay."

"Thank you." Graves stood, extended his paw across the desk. A handshake between equals. "I knew I could count on you. Coach Henderson was right about you. You're exactly the kind of young man this program needs."

Rumi shook his paw. His grip was strong, but there was something uncertain in his eyes. Something that hadn't quite settled.

"I'll be in touch." Graves released the handshake and settled back into his chair. "And Rumi? This conversation stays between us. For Lukas's sake."

The bull nodded once. Then he turned and walked out, footsteps heavy on the carpet.

The door clicked shut.

Graves sat still for a moment, listening to the heavy footsteps fade down the hall. Then he exhaled, slow and measured, and the warmth bled out of his expression like frost sliding off a window. His pale blue eyes went flat as old ice. His claws curled into the leather armrest, leaving marks he'd have someone buff out later.

Rumi Kashtar. Resentment wrapped in muscle. The boy had been nursing that wound for years, letting it rot. All Graves had done was give it a target.

Useful. Predictable. Disposable when the time came.

He watched the campus through the glass. The crow was gone from the science building roof. A maintenance cart trundled across the quad, slow and purposeless. His computer chimed. The sound was soft. Almost polite. A notification he'd set up years ago, back when he still believed in being thorough. He turned to the monitor. Pressed a key.

**SECURITY ALERT: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ATTEMPT**
**Archive Section: Portal Research / Restricted (Pre-2015)**
**User Terminal: Library Basement, Station 7**
**Access: DENIED**
**User ID: G. Kindler (Student)**

Graves's claws stilled on the keyboard.

Kindler. The fox. The one who ran the unofficial lab in the library basement. The clever one who'd been poking around since the human arrived. He pulled up her file. Academic record. Spotless. Research interests. Dimensional theory, portal mechanics, cellular adaptation. Faculty references. Glowing. Clever girl. Too clever for her own good.

She was looking for something. His old research, probably. The early work he'd done before administration swallowed his career. Trying to understand what the human was, where he came from, what it meant. And now she'd tripped a wire she didn't know existed.

Graves leaned back in his chair. Miss Kindler had just made herself useful.

He opened his email. Began to type.

*Miss Kindler,*

*I couldn't help but notice your recent inquiry into restricted research archives. Fascinating curiosity.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

*I'm confident we can resolve this simply. Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*Warm regards,*
*Dean Victor Graves*

Send.

The email disappeared into the system. A small thing. A stone dropped into still water. But ripples had a way of spreading.

Graves turned back to the window. The quad was quiet now. Students drifting between classes, unaware. The library sat in the distance, its old stone walls holding secrets they couldn't begin to imagine.

Somewhere inside, a clever fox was about to learn what happened when you dug too deep.

He settled back in his chair and folded his paws. Friday. It would all be over by Friday. The trap was set. Now all he had to do was wait for the prey to walk into it.
