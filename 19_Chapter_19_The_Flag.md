# Chapter 19: The Flag

They walked.

The path curved around the edge of the quad, past the drained fountain and the old oaks with their bare branches scratching at the gray sky. A few students passed them going the other way, a raccoon with headphones and a pair of rabbits arguing about something that made one of them laugh. The lampposts were starting to flicker on, that in-between hour when the campus couldn't decide if it was still afternoon or already evening. Leaves skittered across the brick path ahead of them, rust and copper against the dark stone. The air had that crisp bite to it, the smell of cold dirt and dying grass.

Cody noticed it somewhere past Whitmore Hall. Lukas wasn't leading, wasn't steering him around cameras or pointing out shortcuts or explaining which buildings had side entrances. He was just walking beside him, their shoulders close enough that Cody could feel the warmth radiating off his fur. For once, that was enough, and it felt new.

The silence between them didn't itch the way silence usually did. Cody didn't feel the need to fill it with something, to perform, to be interesting enough to justify taking up space. He just walked, and Lukas walked with him, and the evening wrapped around them, comfortable and unhurried.

"Koi still spelling things at midnight?" Cody asked.

Lukas's ear flicked toward him. "Only if you're drunk enough to read it."

"Seems like a design flaw. Mystical fish that only talk to alcoholics."

"Campus has priorities." The corner of Lukas's muzzle twitched into something that was almost a smile. "You get used to it."

They passed a cluster of students on a bench, a fox and two deer huddled over a shared textbook. One of them glanced up as they walked by, then went back to the book without a second look. Another evening on campus, a wolf and a human walking together like it was the most normal thing in the world. Cody filed that away. A week ago, he would have felt like a target, an anomaly, something that didn't belong. Now he just felt like a guy walking with his friend. Friend. The word fit strange in his head. Like a jacket he'd forgotten he owned.

"You always like this?" The question came out before he'd decided to ask it.

Lukas glanced at him. "Like what?"

"I don't know." Cody shrugged, hands in his pockets. "Taking in strays. Showing them around."

Lukas was quiet for a few steps. The path curved past a row of evergreens, their branches dark against the fading sky. When he spoke, his voice was lower. Less guarded. "Someone did it for me once. Long time ago."

He didn't elaborate. Cody didn't push. Some doors you let people open on their own time.

They walked in silence for a while after that. The sky was turning purple now, first stars starting to show through gaps in the clouds. Somewhere behind them, a door opened and closed, laughter spilling out and fading.

Lukas slowed. Stopped near a bench under one of the old oaks. He sat down, leaning back against the worn wood, and looked up at the darkening sky. There was something different in his face. Softer. Like he'd set something heavy down and wasn't in a hurry to pick it back up.

"So what's it like?" he asked.

Cody lowered himself onto the bench beside him. "What's what like?"

"Your world." Lukas turned his head, those amber eyes catching what was left of the light. "What's it like?"

The question landed heavier than it should have. Four days Cody had been here. Four days of longer routes and careful paths and Lukas quietly putting himself between Cody and anything that might be a problem. A constant, steady presence steering him through a world he didn't understand yet. And this was the first time anyone had really asked about him. Where he came from. What his life had been like before all this.

Lukas waited patiently, ears forward.

Cody let out a breath. "When I was a kid... it was good. Really good." The memories came easier than he expected. "Summer barbecues in the backyard. The smell of charcoal and cut grass. My mom had this laugh that could fill up a room without even trying." He smiled a little. "My dad used to hoist me onto his shoulders at the county fair. Made the world twice as tall. All those lights and sounds, and I'm up there like I'm king of everything."

Lukas hummed, a low rumble in his chest that said *keep going.*

"We had this thing on Sundays," Cody said. "Pancakes. My mom always burned the first one on purpose. Called it the sacrifice pancake. Said the griddle gods demanded tribute before they'd cooperate."

"She had this garden. Tomatoes and basil, mostly. The whole backyard smelled like it in summer. She had a system. Little stakes with labels, watering schedule on the fridge, the whole thing. My dad used to tease her about it. Called her the plant warden." The smile widened a little. "There was this spot by the lake we'd go every year. Rent the same cabin. Mom would sit on the dock and read. Dad and I would take the rowboat out, try our luck with these old fishing rods that probably belonged to the cabin before we got there. Never caught much. Didn't matter. We'd just sit there, him and me, not saying anything. Watching the water. He'd point out the birds sometimes, tell me which ones were which. I don't remember most of the names now. But I remember the way it felt. Being out there with him."

The smile stayed for a moment longer.

"She got sick when I was eleven." The words came out quiet, and whatever warmth had been in his face drained away, slow and unstoppable.

Lukas leaned back against the bench, his shoulder pressing closer to Cody's. A quiet weight that said *I'm here.*

"Some rare thing they didn't catch until it was too late. One of those cancers that hides until it's everywhere." Cody kept his eyes on the darkening sky. "Took almost a year. I watched her shrink. That's the only word for it. Like she was disappearing a little more every day. Her voice got quieter. Then her laugh. Then her eyes. By the end she was already somewhere else. Even before she stopped breathing."

The words came out flat. Not because he didn't feel them, but because he'd felt them so many times they'd gone numb at the edges, like a scar you forget is there until someone asks about it.

"My dad too," he said. "Not his body. His everything else. He'd sit in that hospital room every day, and I could see pieces of him leaving with her. The part that laughed at her jokes. The part that pointed out the birds. The part that carried me on his shoulders. By the end, I'd lost both of them. She was just the only one who got a funeral."

Lukas didn't say sorry or try to fix it. He sat there beside him, solid and present, and that was enough.

Cody was quiet for a long moment. The campus had gone still around them, just the distant hum of traffic and the rustle of leaves in the wind.

"There's this little cemetery outside town," he said finally, his voice rougher now. "Chain link fence with a gate that never locks right. Grass that gets too long between mowings. An old oak in the back corner with a split trunk from a lightning strike years ago, still growing anyway. Her name's on a marker under that tree. I used to go every Sunday. Sit there. Talk to her about nothing." He swallowed. "Tell her about the book I was reading. Complain about my chemistry teacher. Sometimes I'd bring her flowers from the grocery store, the cheap ones in the plastic wrap. It was all I could afford back then."

He tipped his head back and looked at the sky, all wrong stars and strange patterns, and the weight of it hit him fresh. He'd never stand at her grave again.

"I'm never going to see it again."

His throat tightened. He blinked hard, jaw clenching against the pressure building behind his eyes. Something flickered in his chest, a heat that didn't belong to the grief. He breathed through it until it settled.

They sat in silence. Somewhere across campus a door slammed, someone laughed, life going on the way it does. Cody didn't have to explain what any of it meant. Lukas already got it.

"What would you tell her?"

Cody looked over. Lukas was watching him with that same quiet attention, the kind that didn't demand anything, just waited.

"If you could go back one more time," Lukas said. "What would you say?"

The question hit harder than he expected. Cody sat with it. The seconds stretched out. He turned it over, looking for an answer that didn't feel like too much or not enough. What would he tell her? That he survived? That he found people who actually gave a damn? That for the first time since she died, he didn't feel like he was just waiting for the next bad thing to happen?

He looked at Lukas. The fading light caught the gold in his eyes. Cody opened his mouth.

Lukas's phone buzzed.

The sound shattered the moment like a rock through a window. Lukas blinked, pulled the phone from his pocket, and whatever had been open in his face closed off the second he read the screen.

"It's Gem. We need to go. Now!"

He was already on his feet and moving. Cody pushed himself off the bench and followed, the question still stuck in his throat, the answer he'd almost given already fading into something he might never get a chance to say.

---

They found Gem in the library basement, hunched over her terminal with the kind of focus that said something had gone very wrong. The screens cast blue light across her face, and she didn't look up when they came in.

"Took you long enough." Her voice was flat. Controlled. But Cody could hear the current running underneath it.

"What happened?" Lukas moved to stand behind her, eyes scanning the screens.

"I was digging. After the ID got flagged, I wanted to know why. What we're actually dealing with."

"And?"

"And I found out." She pulled up a window. Text and file names, most of them redacted or incomplete. "Portal arrivals. There have been others, Lukas. Not many. But enough to have a system. Catalogue numbers. Dates. Status reports."

Cody stepped closer, reading over her shoulder. TH-1996-017. TH-2003-005. TH-2010-003. Letters and numbers that used to be people.

"What happened to them?" His voice sounded strange to his own ears.

"That's what I was trying to find out. I went deeper. Tried to access the full records. And I hit this." Gem clicked. The screen flashed red.

**ACCESS DENIED**
**ARCHIVE SECTION: PORTAL RESEARCH / RESTRICTED (PRE-2015)**
**UNAUTHORIZED USER**

"That was two hours ago," Gem said. "Then this showed up."

She opened her email. One new message, sitting at the top of the inbox like a bomb with a blinking timer. She clicked it open. Cody read the words on the screen, and something cold slid down his spine.

*Miss Kindler,*

*I couldn't help but notice your recent inquiry into restricted research archives. Fascinating curiosity.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

*I'm confident we can resolve this simply. Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*Warm regards,*
*Dean Victor Graves*

The timestamp on the email read 4:47 PM. It was past seven now.

"The deadline passed," Cody said. "What does that mean?"

"It means he's not waiting anymore." Gem finally looked at him. Her eyes were steady, but he could see the fear underneath. The anger. "It means whatever he was going to do if you didn't show up, he's already doing it."

Lukas's paw clamped around Cody's arm and yanked him toward the door.

"Lukas, wait!" Cody's heart was hammering, the email's words still burning in his vision.

But Lukas was already pulling him toward the door, grip tight enough to bruise. "Maintenance tunnels. No cameras. You stay hidden until we figure out a plan."

"Shouldn't we talk about this?!"

Lukas didn't answer. He was already moving, hauling Cody with him. Behind them, Gem's fingers flew across the keyboard, her face lit blue by the screen.

The tunnels swallowed them. Pipes ran along the ceiling, some wrapped in insulation that was peeling off in strips, others sweating condensation that dripped onto the concrete below. Caged bulbs threw pools of yellow light every twenty feet or so, leaving long stretches of shadow between. Lukas moved fast, boots echoing off the walls, taking turns without hesitation.

Cody followed, his mind still stuck on the words from that email. Academic standing. Scholarship review. Complications. Because of him. All of it because of him.

They stopped at a heavy metal door, rust creeping up from the hinges. A faded sign read VALVE ROOM 7 - NO ENTRY. Lukas pushed it open, revealing a cramped space lit by a single bulb that buzzed and flickered. Old pipes ran along the walls, valves frozen with age, gauges cracked and dark. A cot sat in the corner, the kind you'd find in an army surplus store, its canvas sagging in the middle.

"Stay here." Lukas's voice was tight. "Don't open the door for anyone. Three short knocks, two long. That's me. Anyone else, you don't answer."

"Lukas, this is my problem." Cody's voice cracked on the last word.

"This is me keeping you safe. Let me do that. Please!" Lukas's eyes were wet, his jaw tight, the panic barely held together by the need to move.

Cody nodded.

Lukas turned and pulled the door shut behind him.

The footsteps soon faded and silence pressed in.

Cody stood in the dim room, surrounded by dead gauges and rusted pipes, the conversation that never got to end still rattling around in his head. The email played on loop. Gem's face when she showed them. The way Lukas had grabbed his arm like he was afraid Cody might disappear. Academic standing. Scholarship review. Gem could lose everything she'd worked for. Lukas could lose his future, the scholarship that was supposed to carry him to professional ball, to a life beyond this place. Because of Cody. Because he'd fallen through a hole in the sky and landed in their lives like a grenade with the pin already pulled.

He crossed to the cot and sat down, the canvas creaking under his weight. The peace from the walk felt like it belonged to someone else now, some version of him from an hour ago who didn't know what was coming.

*That I found people who give a damn.*

He'd almost said it. Almost told Lukas what he meant. What he was starting to feel. Now he was sitting in an abandoned valve room while everyone he cared about scrambled to protect him from a threat he'd brought to their door.

Something stirred behind his ribs, heavier than rage. Guilt wrapped in helplessness, coiling tight.

His mother's face flashed through his mind. Not the smiling one from the pancake mornings. The other one. The one at the end, when she was too tired to pretend anymore. When she'd looked at him and he'd seen the apology in her eyes, like dying was something she was doing wrong. He'd sat there every day after school, holding her hand, watching her fade, and there was nothing he could do. Not a damn thing. Just watch.

And now people he cared about were in danger. This time it wasn't some disease he couldn't fight. This time it was him. He was the problem.

The email's words burned in his skull. Have the human come to Office 412.

Alone.

The word sat there. Waiting.
