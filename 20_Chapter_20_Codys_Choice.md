# Chapter 20: Cody's Choice

The word sat there. Waiting.

*Alone.*

Cody stared at the rusted pipes running along the ceiling. The cot's canvas dug into his back. The email kept circling, the same words wearing a groove into his skull: *Academic standing. Scholarship review. Have the human come to Office 412.*

He already knew what he was going to do. He'd known since Lukas pulled the door shut and left him here with three short knocks and two long. Maybe he'd known before that, when he saw Gem's face in the blue light of her terminal, the fear she was trying to hide underneath the anger. The logic was simple, the kind of calculation his pattern brain did without being asked. Dean wanted the human. Gem and Lukas were in the crosshairs because they'd helped the human. Remove the human from the equation, and the crosshairs had nothing to aim at.

*If I go, he leaves them alone.*

He sat up, the canvas groaning. The deadline had been five o'clock. It was past seven now. Whatever Graves was going to do, he was already doing it, and every minute Cody sat here hiding was another minute the people who'd helped him were paying for it.

And maybe, if he played it right, Graves would make good on that offer from this morning. *A way home.* The words surfaced unbidden, and Cody let himself turn them over. Back to the apartment with the stained carpet and the empty fridge. Back to his father's hollow eyes and the bottles lined up like soldiers on the kitchen counter. Back to the bus stop and the community college and the C-minus life he'd been sleepwalking through before the portal swallowed him whole. It wasn't much of a life. He'd hated most of it. But it was his, and going back to it meant Gem kept her research and Lukas kept his future and nobody else had to bleed for the mistake of caring about Cody Guiles.

Four days. That's all it had been. Four days of someone making him coffee in the morning. Four days of walking next to someone who didn't flinch when their shoulders brushed. Four days of almost saying something on a bench under the stars before a phone buzzed and stole the moment. And now he was going to trade all of it for a drunk father and a dead mother's grave and the same empty routine he'd been drowning in before.

It should have felt like a sacrifice. It felt like coming home to a house that had already burned down.

Cody crossed to the door and put his hand on the cold metal. The rust was rough under his palm. He thought about Lukas coming back to find the room empty, the cot still warm, no answer to the knock. He thought about the look on Lukas's face when he figured out where Cody had gone.

He pushed the door open anyway.

---

The tunnels swallowed him the same way they had before, pipes running overhead like exposed veins, caged bulbs throwing pools of yellow light every twenty feet with long stretches of shadow between. Cody moved fast, his footsteps echoing off the concrete walls, the smell of rust and damp filling his nose. He didn't know these tunnels the way Lukas did, but he remembered enough from the walk down to find his way back to the surface.

A set of metal stairs brought him up through a service entrance behind the library, and then he was outside, the cold night air hitting his face like a slap. The campus was quiet at this hour, most of the students either in their dorms or gathered somewhere with better lighting and warmer company. A few lampposts threw circles of orange light across the brick paths, and the trees stood bare and dark against a sky that couldn't decide if it wanted to be cloudy or clear.

Whitmore Hall sat at the far end of the quad, the same brick and ivy he'd walked into this morning when everything still felt like it might be okay. He knew the route now: front doors, past the reception desk, old elevator to the fourth floor, carpeted hallway to the door at the end. He'd done it once already today, following a note that promised answers. Now he was doing it again, following a threat that promised consequences.

He kept his head down as he crossed the quad, hands in his pockets, trying to look like any other student heading somewhere boring. A pair of rabbits passed him going the other way, arguing about a group project, and neither of them gave him a second glance. A raccoon in a maintenance uniform was fiddling with something near one of the lampposts, and Cody felt the guy's eyes on him for a second before he looked away. Probably nothing. Probably just some guy on the night shift. But the back of his neck prickled anyway.

The front doors of Whitmore Hall were unlocked, the lobby quiet and empty except for the same bored-looking badger behind the reception desk. The badger glanced up when Cody walked in, and this time there was no flicker of confusion, no moment of processing. Just recognition, and something that might have been expectation.

"He's waiting for you," the badger said. "Fourth floor."

Cody didn't ask how he knew. He just nodded and walked past the desk, feeling the badger's eyes on his back the whole way. The elevator was an old one, the kind with a metal grate that had to be pulled closed by hand, and it groaned and shuddered as it climbed. Fourth floor. The hallway was carpeted, muffling his footsteps, the walls lined with framed photos of past deans and graduating classes going back decades, everyone smiling, everyone looking successful and happy and like they belonged here.

Office 412 was at the end of the hall, heavy wooden door, brass nameplate: *Victor Graves, Ph.D. — Dean of Academic Affairs.*

The door was already open. Just like this morning. *My door is always open.*

Cody stopped at the threshold. Through the gap, he could see the edge of the window, the campus lights glittering below, the Dean's silhouette already turned toward the door. Waiting. He'd known Cody was coming. Of course he had. The window faced the quad. He'd probably watched Cody cross the whole way, counting his footsteps, timing his arrival.

"Come in, Cody." The voice was soft, warm, carrying that same friendly-uncle tone from this morning. "I was hoping you'd change your mind."

Cody stepped inside.

---

The office looked exactly the same as it had this morning.

Floor-to-ceiling windows with the campus spread out below. Family photos on the shelves: the silver-furred lynx with kind eyes, the graduation robes, the vacation shot with mountains. Ribbon-cutting photos on the walls, the thank-you card from the Class of 2019, the crayon drawing taped to the bookshelf like it meant something. The mahogany desk with the worn spot where paws rested, the "World's Okayest Dean" mug, the bowl of wrapped butterscotch candies catching the light.

The whole performance, unchanged. The mask made of furniture and frames.

This morning, Cody's pattern brain had flagged all of it: the dusty frames that hadn't been moved in years, the photos positioned outward instead of toward the desk, the candy bowl that was always the same amount. He'd walked out of here with doubt planted in his chest, wondering if the people protecting him were really protecting him or just keeping him scared. Now he was back, and nothing had changed. The room was still a stage. The props were still in place. The only difference was that this time, Cody knew he was walking into a trap.

Dean Victor Graves sat behind the desk in his charcoal suit, pale blue eyes taking in everything without giving anything back. He gestured to the chair across from him, and the smile on his face was warm, almost relieved, like a father seeing his kid come home after curfew.

The two chairs faced the desk, positioned so visitors sat backlit against the windows. Cody had noticed it this morning, the way Graves controlled the light, and he noticed it again now as he lowered himself into the left chair. The question was whether Graves knew that Cody knew.

"I have to admit, I wondered how long you'd wait," Graves said. "After our conversation this morning, I thought you might need more time. But here you are." He spread his paws, that gesture of openness he'd used before. "I'm glad you didn't let pride get in the way."

"You threatened my friends."

Graves tilted his head, mild surprise crossing his face. "Threatened? Cody, I simply pointed out the potential consequences of certain actions. Miss Kindler accessed restricted archives without authorization. That's a serious academic violation. I was trying to help her understand the situation before it escalated."

"And Lukas's scholarship?"

"Mr. Raines has been making some questionable choices lately. Missing practices. Avoiding his academic advisor. Using university resources in ways that raise questions." Graves spread his paws again. "I'm not the one who decides these things, Cody. I simply wanted you to understand the position your friends have put themselves in. For your sake, not as a threat."

The reasonable tone. The framing of everything as concern, as help, as the logical position of someone who just wanted to make sure everyone was okay. This morning it had worked on him, at least partly. The doubt had taken root, and he'd spent the whole day looking at Lukas and Gem through a poisoned lens, wondering if they were protecting him or controlling him.

But that was before the email. Before the threat. Before Cody realized that all of Graves's reasonable concern had been building toward this moment.

"What do you want?" Cody asked.

"I want to help you." Graves leaned forward, his pale eyes holding Cody's gaze. "We talked about this this morning. You fell through a dimensional rift. You're alone in a world you don't understand, surrounded by people you've known for less than a week. And your friends, as well-meaning as they are, have been keeping you hidden, keeping you in the dark, making decisions for you instead of with you."

The script hadn't changed. The manipulation was the same. But this time Cody let him talk.

"I know you want to go home," Graves said, and the words landed harder than they should have. "I could see it in your face this morning when I mentioned the possibility. The way you went still. The way something flickered behind your eyes." He paused, letting that sit. "You've wanted it since the moment you arrived, haven't you? Even if you couldn't admit it to yourself."

That wasn't true. This morning, Cody hadn't known what he wanted. He'd walked out of this office more confused than when he'd walked in, doubt and hope tangled together in a knot he couldn't untie. But the way Graves said it, so certain, so knowing, made Cody wonder if he was misremembering. Maybe he had wanted to go home all along. Maybe he'd just been too scared to see it.

That was the trick, wasn't it? Telling you what you felt until you believed it.

He thought about the apartment. The stained carpet, the empty fridge, the bottles on the counter. His father's eyes that looked through him instead of at him. The bus stop in the morning cold, the classrooms where no one knew his name, the grave he visited every Sunday because it was the only conversation he had left. He'd hated that life. He'd been drowning in it. But it was his, and there was something in his chest that ached for it anyway. Or maybe Graves was just good at making him think there was.

"What if I could send you back?" Graves asked. "The portal that brought you here isn't fully understood. But with proper study, with the right resources, there might be a way to recreate the conditions. The university has archives going back over a century. Equipment. Expertise. If anyone can find a way to return you to your world, it's us."

Home. His mother's grave under the oak tree with the lightning-split trunk. The chain-link fence that never locked right. Cheap flowers in plastic wrap. Sunday mornings talking to a headstone because there was no one else left to talk to.

He could go back to that. He could leave this place, leave Lukas and Gem and the pack, leave behind four days of feeling like he might actually belong somewhere. He could trade all of it for a drunk father and an empty apartment and the same gray routine he'd been suffocating in before the sky opened up and swallowed him whole.

And Gem would keep her standing. And Lukas would keep his scholarship. And no one else would have to pay for helping Cody Guiles.

"What would I have to do?" The question came out steady. Flat. Like he'd already made up his mind.

Something flickered in Graves's eyes, there and gone. Satisfaction, maybe. The look of a fisherman feeling the first tug on the line.

"Nothing invasive," Graves said smoothly. "Some tests. Observation. Documentation of your biology, your adaptation process. We'd want to understand what made you different, what allowed you to survive when others didn't." His paws opened, palms up, the picture of reasonableness. "You'd be helping us save lives, Cody. Future arrivals who might not be as lucky as you."

And there it was. The tell.

When Graves said "observation," his claws flexed against the armrest, just once, a tiny curl of the tips into the leather. His voice stayed smooth, his face stayed warm, but his body knew what "observation" really meant. Cody's pattern brain flagged it the way it flagged a defensive lineman shifting his weight before the snap. The Dean was lying. Not about all of it, maybe, but about enough.

He'd walked into a trap. He'd known it was probably a trap, and he'd walked in anyway, and now the jaws were closing.

"Why me?" Cody asked, keeping his voice steady. "You said others came through before. What happened to them?"

Graves's smile didn't waver. "You're unique, Cody. A human who survived dimensional transit intact. Do you have any idea how rare that is? The others... didn't fare as well. But the scientific implications of your survival are extraordinary. And I want to make sure you're treated with the respect and care that your situation deserves. Not hidden in maintenance tunnels like a problem to be managed."

"And if I say no?"

The smile stayed in place, but something shifted behind the Dean's eyes. The warmth was still there, but it felt thinner now, like paint over rusted metal.

"Then I'd be very disappointed," Graves said. "And I'd worry about your friends, Cody. Miss Kindler's inquiry into restricted archives has already been flagged. Mr. Raines's scholarship is already under review. These processes move forward whether you cooperate or not. But if you work with me, if you let me help you, I can make sure those processes reach the right conclusions." He spread his paws again. "I'm not your enemy. I'm offering you a path forward. The only question is whether you're brave enough to take it."

Cody's hands had curled into fists on the armrests, and he made himself relax them. The rage was there, coiling tight behind his ribs, the same thing that had gotten him in trouble on the football field. He could feel it pushing at the edges of his control, wanting out.

He forced himself to breathe.

"I need to think about it," he said.

"Of course." Graves nodded, still smiling. "Take all the time you need." He glanced at the clock on the corner of his desk. "Although I should mention that the situation with your friends will continue to develop regardless of your decision. The wheels are already in motion. But I understand if you need a moment to process."

Cody stood up. The chair creaked beneath him, and he turned toward the door, every instinct screaming at him to get out of this room, to find Lukas, to run.

He heard the click of a lock engaging.

"I'm afraid I can't let you leave, Cody."

The voice was different. Still soft, still quiet, but the warmth had bled out of it like heat escaping through a cracked window. Cody turned back, and the man behind the desk wasn't the same man who'd welcomed him in. The smile was gone. The pale blue eyes had gone flat and cold, and his claws were visible now, curved tips pressing lightly into the leather armrest.

"You came willingly," Graves said. "That simplifies the paperwork."

"What—"

"You really thought you could read me?" The Dean's voice was clinical now, precise, every word measured and placed. "I've been doing this for forty years, Cody. I saw you cataloguing the room the moment you walked in. The photos, the positioning, the tells. You thought you were being clever. You thought your little pattern recognition trick gave you an advantage." He stood, and the movement was slow, deliberate, a predator who didn't need to hurry. "I let you see exactly what I wanted you to see. And you walked right into it."

Cody lunged for the door, but it didn't budge. The lock was electronic, something built into the frame, and the handle turned uselessly in his grip. He spun back around, and Graves was already reaching for something on his desk, a small radio that looked like it belonged in a security office.

"Two for escort," the Dean said into it. "Office 412. The subject is secured."

*Subject.* The word landed like a punch to the gut.

"You can't do this." Cody's voice came out steadier than he felt. "People know I'm here. Lukas knows—"

"Mr. Raines knows you were in a maintenance room. He'll return to find it empty. He'll search the tunnels, the dorm, the library. By the time he thinks to check my office, you'll be somewhere else entirely." Graves set the radio down and clasped his paws behind his back, watching Cody the way you'd watch a bug in a jar. "The science building has an isolation ward in the sub-basement. Room B-7. No windows. Excellent soundproofing. You'll be very comfortable there."

The rage hit him then, fast and hot, flooding up from his chest into his arms. His hands curled into fists and his vision narrowed, and for a second he was back on that football field, back in that moment when everything went red and the only thing that mattered was making someone pay. He took a step toward Graves, and his whole body was shaking with the need to do something, to fight, to make this stop.

Graves didn't flinch. He just watched, those flat blue eyes taking in every detail, and the corner of his mouth curved upward.

"There it is," he said quietly. "The stress response. I've seen it before, in the others. Something in the biology of cross-dimensional survivors, something that runs hotter than it should." He tilted his head, studying Cody the way you'd study a specimen under glass. "The last one showed the same pattern before she expired. Elevated heart rate, pupils dilated, hands shaking. We never got to document it properly. She didn't last long enough." His smile returned, thin and clinical. "You will."

The door behind Cody opened. He turned to find two security guards filling the frame, a bear and a wolf in dark uniforms, both of them built like they spent their off-hours throwing around weights. The bear was holding something that looked like a heavy-duty zip tie, the kind you'd use on luggage or industrial equipment.

"Restrain him," Graves said. "Carefully. I don't want any marks that would complicate the documentation."

Cody swung at the bear, and the punch connected with something solid before the wolf's arm hooked around his throat from behind and yanked him backward. He thrashed, kicked, tried to break free, but they were stronger than him and there were two of them and his arms were being wrenched behind his back before he could land another hit. The zip tie bit into his wrists, plastic edges digging in, and then something else was going around his ankles and he was on the ground, the carpet rough against his cheek, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

"Transport him to B-7," Graves said from somewhere above him. "I'll be along shortly to begin the intake process."

Cody felt himself being lifted, slung over the bear's shoulder like a sack of laundry, and then they were moving. Down the hallway. Into the elevator. The metal grate rattled closed, and the last thing he saw before the doors blocked his view was Dean Victor Graves standing in the doorway of Office 412, straightening his cuffs, his face as calm and empty as a frozen lake.

The elevator shuddered and began to descend.

Something pricked the side of his neck. The wolf's paw, holding a syringe. Cody tried to jerk away but there was nowhere to go, and the bear's grip tightened, pinning him in place while the plunger went down.

"Standard sedative," the wolf said to no one in particular. "He'll be out in thirty seconds."

The fluorescent lights in the elevator ceiling started to blur. Cody blinked, trying to hold on, trying to stay awake, but his thoughts were already going soft at the edges, dissolving like sugar in water. The last thing he felt was the bear's shoulder digging into his stomach, and the last thing he heard was the elevator grinding to a stop somewhere far below.

Then nothing.
