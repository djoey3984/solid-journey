# Chapter 21: Room B-7

The first thing Cody noticed was the cold.

It seeped through his clothes, through his skin, settling somewhere deep in his bones like it had always been there and he was just now waking up to it. His head felt stuffed with cotton, his thoughts moving slow and thick, and when he tried to open his eyes the fluorescent light above him hit like a camera flash set off two inches from his face.

He tried to move his arm. It didn't move.

The restraint around his wrist was padded, medical-grade, the kind you'd see in a hospital psych ward. His other wrist had one too, and when he tried to shift his legs he found the same thing at his ankles. He was lying on something flat and hard, slightly reclined, and the surface under him was cold metal covered by a thin layer of paper that crinkled when he moved. An examination table. The kind a doctor would use for a physical, except doctors didn't usually strap you down first.

His mouth tasted like pennies and his throat was dry. They'd given him something. In the elevator, maybe, or right after. He couldn't remember. Everything after the guards hauled him out of Office 412 was a blur of motion and voices and then nothing.

He blinked until his eyes adjusted, and the room came into focus around him. Maybe fifteen feet square, walls painted the same institutional beige you'd find in a DMV waiting room. No windows. One door, heavy and metal, with a small reinforced glass panel at eye level and an electronic keypad on the wall beside it. A camera mounted in the corner near the ceiling, red light blinking steady. Equipment lined the walls: a heart monitor on a rolling stand, a tray of instruments covered with a blue cloth, some kind of machine with dials and readouts that looked like it belonged in a Cold War bunker. The air smelled like disinfectant and something else underneath, chemical and sharp, making his nose itch.

Cody's pattern brain did its thing automatically, cataloguing details whether he wanted it to or not. The door opened inward. The keypad had a three-second delay after the beep before the lock engaged, he could hear it cycling when footsteps passed in the hallway outside. The camera covered most of the room but had a blind spot near the instrument tray. The ventilation grate in the ceiling was maybe eight inches wide, bolted in place, way too small for a person but big enough to carry sound. He could hear the hum of machinery somewhere above him, the building breathing.

None of it mattered. He was strapped to a table in a soundproofed basement and nobody knew where he was.

The word came back to him, landing with the same weight it had in Graves's office. *Subject.* That's what he was now. A subject. Something to be documented and studied and eventually filed away when they were done with him. Not Cody Guiles from nowhere Pennsylvania with a dead mother and a drunk father and a pattern brain that couldn't stop noticing things. A specimen on a table.

He'd walked right into it.

He made himself breathe. Slow. Steady. The way his old coach had taught him before games, back when football was still something he cared about. If he looked at the restraints too long he could feel the panic starting to build in his chest, that animal urge to thrash and pull and tear until something gave. So he stared at the ceiling tiles instead, at the water stains in one corner spreading outward like tree rings counting the years since anyone bothered to fix the leak.

Dean Graves had played him. Every step of it, from the first conversation in Office 412 to the email to the moment Cody pushed open that valve room door, all of it had been exactly what Graves wanted. The reasonable tone, the concern, the offer of help. The doubt he'd planted about Lukas and Gem, making Cody look at the people protecting him through a lens of suspicion. The threat to their futures, delivered with such calm professionalism that it didn't even sound like a threat.

And Cody had done exactly what Graves predicted. He'd let his wound drive him. *People get hurt when I'm around.* The same thought that had followed him since his mother's hospital bed, since his father started disappearing into bottles, since his best friend crossed the street to avoid him. He'd taken that wound and let Graves use it as a lever, prying him out of the valve room and straight into the trap.

The sacrifice wasn't noble. It was stupid. It was exactly what a manipulator would expect from someone who believed they were poison to everyone around them.

Gem was probably still flagged for the archive access. Lukas's scholarship was probably still under review. Cody had traded his freedom for nothing, and now he was strapped to a table in a basement while a snow leopard with forty years of practice at this game decided what to do with him.

His hands curled into fists against the restraints, and he felt that familiar pressure building behind his ribs again. The anger wanted out. It always wanted out when he felt trapped, cornered, powerless. But losing control now wouldn't help anyone.

He let it burn. But he didn't let it take over. Not yet.

Because his brain didn't stop working just because he was strapped to a table. And somewhere in the back of his skull, behind the panic and the anger, the pattern recognition was still running.

The door beeped and swung inward, and Dean Victor Graves walked into Room B-7 like he was entering his own living room.

He'd changed out of the charcoal suit. Now he wore a white lab coat over a simple button-down, sleeves rolled to the elbows, reading glasses perched on his nose. The costume of a researcher rather than an administrator. He was carrying a tablet in one paw and a coffee mug in the other, steam curling up from whatever was inside, and he moved to the instrument tray without looking at Cody first. Set the mug down. Tapped at the screen. Checked one of the machines along the wall.

When he finally turned to face the table, the mask was gone. The smile, the warmth, all of it stripped away, leaving nothing but calm, clinical interest, the way a mechanic might look at an engine he was about to take apart.

"You're awake," Graves said. "Good. The sedative dosage was estimated based on your body weight. I wasn't certain how your physiology would process it."

Cody's throat was still dry, but he made himself speak anyway. "Let me go."

Graves didn't even acknowledge the words. He pulled a rolling stool from under the instrument tray and sat down, positioning himself at Cody's eye level the way a vet might sit beside a dog on an examination table. "I'll explain what's happening so you can process it. Understanding tends to reduce stress responses in subjects, and I want clean data."

"I know what's happening. You're a psychopath who kidnaps people."

Something flickered across Graves's face, there and gone. Mild disappointment, maybe, the way a teacher might look at a student who gave the wrong answer. "I'm a scientist, Cody. I've spent forty years studying dimensional anomalies, portal events, and the biological implications of cross-dimensional transit. When I started this work, my colleagues called me a crackpot. A fringe theorist chasing shadows. I published papers that were rejected by every major journal in my field. I sat through faculty meetings where people made jokes about my research while pretending I couldn't hear them."

He paused, adjusting the tablet on his knee, scrolling through data Cody couldn't read from this angle.

"Fourteen years ago, a portal event occurred on this campus. A human subject came through, similar to you. TH-2010-003, that was the designation. Female, early twenties, severely disoriented upon arrival. She survived the initial transit, which was remarkable in itself. The biological stress of dimensional crossing usually kills within hours. But she lasted three days." Graves looked up from the tablet, those pale blue eyes holding Cody's gaze. "Three days of observation before her system failed. Not enough time to complete the documentation. Not enough data to prove anything."

Cody felt something cold slide down his spine that had nothing to do with the room temperature.

"You're going to last longer," Graves said. "You've already lasted longer. Four days and counting, with no signs of systemic breakdown. Your cellular structure has adapted to this dimension's baseline reality in ways I've never seen before. Do you understand what that means?"

"That I'm a person?" The words came out harder than Cody intended, sharp and raw. "Not a lab rat?"

Graves tilted his head, considering that. "You're both, actually. You're a person who happens to be the most significant scientific specimen to appear in my lifetime. Your biology could unlock answers to questions no one has even learned to ask yet. Portal mechanics. Dimensional stability. The nature of reality itself." He leaned forward slightly. "You're going to make history, Cody. My history. When I publish these findings, when the data is undeniable, every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name. Every colleague who laughed will have to cite my work in their own papers. I've waited forty years for vindication. And here you are."

The camera in the corner was still blinking. Recording everything. Graves didn't even glance at it. Why would he? This was his building, his basement, his kingdom. No one was coming to review the footage. No one even knew this room existed.

"What are you going to do to me?" Cody asked.

"Document you." Graves stood, tucking the tablet under his arm. "Blood work, tissue samples, neurological scans. We'll monitor your cellular adaptation over time, track any anomalies in your physiology. I have equipment here that most universities can't afford, legacy systems from research programs that were quietly defunded when the government decided portal science wasn't worth pursuing." He walked to one of the machines along the wall, running his paw along its surface with what looked almost like affection. "Tomorrow we'll begin the intake protocols. Tonight, you rest. The sedative will be out of your system by morning, and I want clean baselines for the initial readings."

He gathered his coffee mug and moved toward the door, then paused with his paw on the keypad.

"I know you think I'm a monster," he said, not turning around. "I don't expect you to understand what this work means. You're twenty years old. You've never dedicated your life to something, never sacrificed everything for a truth no one else could see. But someday, when the textbooks are written and the history is settled, people will know that Victor Graves was right. That his research changed the world." He punched in the code, and the door beeped. "Get some rest, Cody. We have a lot of work ahead of us."

The door swung shut behind him. The lock cycled with a heavy click.

Cody lay there in the fluorescent buzz, staring at the ceiling, running the variables without meaning to.

Graves hadn't rushed. Hadn't checked the time or mentioned any deadline. He'd talked like a man who had all the time in the world, savoring the moment like a meal he'd been waiting forty years to eat. A scientist with his specimen, settling in for the long haul.

The door opened again maybe twenty minutes later. The wolf guard who'd helped wrestle Cody to the ground in the office stuck his head in, did a visual check, grunted, and pulled the door shut. Cody heard him talking to someone in the hallway, the words muffled but audible through the gap before the door sealed.

"Radio's worthless down here. Gotta walk all the way to the goddamn stairwell just to check in."

A second voice, deeper, probably the bear. "At least we're not dealing with that busted fire door. Thing's been on the maintenance list since I started."

"Right next to that service access in storage. When's the last time anyone even opened that thing?"

The bear laughed, a low rumble. "Probably before we were born. Come on, I need coffee."

Footsteps receding down the hallway. Then silence.

Cody let the words settle into the back of his skull, filing them away automatically. Radio dead zone. Fire door on the maintenance list. Service access in storage that nobody ever used.

He didn't know where the storage room was. He didn't know where the service access led. He didn't know if Lukas and Gem even knew he was gone yet, or if they'd have any way to find him even if they did. The pack might already be scrambling, or they might think he just ran off. He had no way to communicate, no way to send a message, no way to do anything except lie here and wait.

But his pattern brain kept working anyway, because that's what it did. It took the pieces and arranged them, looking for the shape underneath.

Radio dead zone meant the guards couldn't call for backup from down here. They had to physically walk to the stairwell to check in. That was a window. Maybe thirty seconds, maybe a minute, depending on how far away the stairwell was.

Service access in storage. A back way. Something old and forgotten, probably connected to the same tunnel network that ran under the whole campus. The tunnels Lukas knew better than anyone.

If they came for him. If they found this place. If everything lined up just right.

He'd know what to do.

Cody tested the restraints one more time, feeling the padded edges dig into his wrists. No give. No slack. He wasn't going anywhere under his own power.

But he wasn't helpless either. He had information. He had a brain that wouldn't stop working. And he had one more thing, too, one thing he hadn't had back home in that apartment with the stained carpet and the empty fridge.

He had people who might actually come for him.

The fluorescent light buzzed overhead. The camera blinked its steady red. Somewhere above him, the building breathed through its vents, and Cody lay there in the cold, running the variables, waiting for a moment that might never come.

But if it did, he'd be ready.
