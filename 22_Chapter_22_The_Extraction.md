# Chapter 22: The Extraction

Time had stopped meaning anything.

Cody lay on the examination table, staring at the same water-stained ceiling tiles he'd been looking at for what felt like forever. The fluorescent light buzzed overhead, the camera blinked its steady red, and the restraints held his wrists and ankles in the same padded grip they'd held him in since he woke up. Nothing had changed. Nothing was going to change. Graves had left hours ago, or maybe it had been minutes, and the guards had checked on him twice, or maybe three times, and somewhere along the way Cody had stopped counting.

His pattern brain kept running anyway, cycling through the same information like a song stuck on repeat. Radio dead zone. Service access in storage. Guards have to walk to the stairwell to call for backup. The pieces were there, arranged and ready, but they didn't matter if no one came to use them. And with every hour that passed, the possibility that anyone was coming at all felt thinner and thinner, like a balloon slowly losing air.

He thought about Lukas coming back to the valve room and finding it empty. The cot still warm. The door unlocked. He thought about the look on Lukas's face when he realized what Cody had done, and whether that look was angry or hurt or just exhausted. He thought about Gem and Benji and Thorne and the rest of the pack, and whether they even knew he was gone, and whether knowing would make them come running or just make them shake their heads and move on with their lives.

Maybe this was it. Maybe he'd finally found the place where his pattern of driving people away ended, because there was nowhere left to drive them. He was strapped to a table in a basement that didn't exist on any map, and the only person who knew exactly where he was had no intention of letting him leave.

The fluorescent light buzzed overhead while the camera blinked its steady red, and Cody closed his eyes and tried not to think about anything at all.

The footsteps woke him up.

He hadn't meant to fall asleep, but the exhaustion had crept in somewhere between the third and fourth hour, dragging him down into a shallow, dreamless dark. Now his eyes snapped open and his whole body went rigid, straining against the restraints as he tried to figure out what had changed.

Footsteps in the hallway. That wasn't new. The guards checked on him regularly, heavy boots on concrete, the same rhythm every time. But these footsteps were different. Too many of them, moving too fast, and the rhythm was all wrong, like someone had kicked over a drum set in the middle of a song.

Then the shouting started.

"Hey! You can't..."

The voice cut off with a heavy thud, the sound of something large hitting the floor, and Cody's heart slammed into his ribs hard enough to hurt. He pulled against the restraints, craning his neck toward the door, trying to see through the small reinforced window. Shadows moved in the hallway. Another impact, another grunt of pain, and then footsteps again, closer now, almost running.

The keypad beeped.

The door swung open.

Lukas stood in the frame, chest heaving, fur disheveled, eyes wild and searching until they landed on Cody. For a second neither of them moved. Relief and anger and fear all tangled together on Lukas's face, and then he was across the room in three long strides, paws gripping the sides of the examination table, pulling Cody into a hug that bent him awkwardly against the restraints.

"You stupid..." Lukas's voice cracked, and he couldn't finish the sentence. His arms tightened, his muzzle pressed against Cody's shoulder, and Cody could feel him shaking. Whether it was adrenaline or emotion or both, he couldn't tell.

"Lukas..."

"I know." Lukas pulled back, and his eyes were wet but his jaw was set, the anger winning out over the relief. "I know. We're gonna talk about this later. Right now we move."

A massive shape filled the doorway behind him. Thorne, shoulders barely fitting through the frame, paws taped and ready. He stepped over the unconscious guard in the hallway without looking down and moved straight to the examination table, claws working at the buckles on Cody's restraints with surprising precision for paws that size. He didn't say anything, didn't need to, just met Cody's eyes once with a brief nod, and then the first restraint came loose and blood rushed back into Cody's wrist with a pins-and-needles burn.

"How did you..." Cody started.

"Later." Lukas was watching the door, ears swiveling toward the hallway. "Can you walk?"

Cody flexed his ankles as Thorne freed them, testing the feeling. His legs were stiff and his muscles ached from hours of lying in the same position, but the sedative had worn off a long time ago. "Yeah. Yeah, I can walk."

"Good." Lukas grabbed his arm and hauled him upright. The room tilted for a second, Cody's vision going gray at the edges, but he blinked it away and steadied himself against the edge of the table. Lukas was already moving toward the door. "Let's go."

They moved into the hallway, Thorne leading. The guard on the floor was the wolf, out cold, a bruise already forming on the side of his muzzle. Thorne stepped over him like he was stepping over a crack in the sidewalk, and Lukas kept one paw on Cody's arm, steadying him as they walked.

They made it maybe twenty feet before Cody heard it.

Footsteps. Coming from the direction they were heading. More than one set, moving fast.

Thorne stopped. Lukas stopped. They exchanged a look that said everything without words: the way they'd come in was blocked.

"Wait!" Cody's voice came out rough, but steady. "There's another way."

Lukas turned to him. "What?"

"Storage room." Cody pointed down the hallway, toward the end where it curved out of sight. "End of the hall. There's a service access that connects to the tunnels. And the radios don't work down here. The guards have to walk all the way to the stairwell to call for backup." He met Lukas's eyes. "That's our window."

"How do you know that?"

There was something in Lukas's voice Cody had never heard before. Surprise, maybe, the kind that comes when the person you've been protecting suddenly has the answer you need.

Cody felt his spine straighten. He'd been strapped to that table for hours, helpless, useless, and the whole time his brain had been doing what it always did. Gathering pieces. Finding patterns. Waiting for a moment that might never come. But the moment was here now, and he had an answer to give.

"I listened."

For a second Lukas just stared at him. Then he nodded once, sharp and decisive. "Lead the way."

Cody moved.

His legs protested with every step, muscles cramping and joints popping after hours of immobility, but he pushed through it because there wasn't any other option. The hallway stretched ahead of him, fluorescent lights throwing harsh shadows, doors on either side labeled with numbers and letters that meant nothing to him. Behind him he could hear Lukas's breathing, quick and controlled, and Thorne's heavier footfalls, steady as a heartbeat.

The storage room was exactly where the guards had said it would be, a heavy metal door with a faded sign that read MAINTENANCE: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Cody tried the handle, but it was locked.

Thorne shouldered past him without breaking stride. One massive paw gripped the handle, the other braced against the frame, and with a single sharp motion the lock gave way with a crack like a branch snapping. The door swung inward, revealing a cramped room full of shelves and cleaning supplies and, in the far corner, a metal hatch set into the floor.

"There." Cody crossed to the hatch and dropped to his knees, fingers finding the handle. It was old and rusted, the kind of thing that hadn't been touched in years, and when he pulled it groaned in protest but swung open, revealing a ladder descending into darkness.

The smell hit him immediately: rust and damp and old concrete. The tunnels. The same network that ran under the whole campus, the ones Lukas had led him through on his first day here.

"Go," Lukas said. "I'm right behind you."

Cody went. The ladder rungs were cold under his palms, slick with condensation, and he climbed down into the dark as fast as he dared. His feet hit solid ground and he moved aside, making room as Lukas dropped down after him, then Thorne, the big bear somehow fitting through the hatch despite his shoulders.

Above them, voices echoed in the storage room. The guards had found the broken door.

"Move," Thorne said, the first word he'd spoken since they'd found Cody. His voice was low and calm, like they were walking to practice instead of running for their lives.

They moved.

The tunnels swallowed them whole, pipes running overhead, caged bulbs throwing pools of yellow light every thirty feet or so. Cody didn't know this section the way he knew the route between the valve room and the library, but the layout was familiar, the same industrial bones running under the whole campus. He picked a direction and ran, trusting his pattern brain to find the way out, and behind him Lukas and Thorne kept pace, their footsteps echoing off the concrete walls.

They ran for what felt like forever but was probably only a few minutes, the tunnel branching and splitting, Cody making choices based on instinct and the faint movement of air that suggested an exit somewhere ahead. His lungs burned and his legs screamed and his heart pounded so hard he could feel it in his teeth, but he didn't stop, couldn't stop, because stopping meant getting caught and getting caught meant going back to that table and he was never going back to that table again.

The tunnel ended at a set of metal stairs leading up.

Cody took them two at a time, shoulder slamming into the door at the top, and then he was outside, cold night air flooding his lungs, stars scattered across a sky that had never looked so beautiful. He stumbled forward, almost falling, catching himself on a chain-link fence as Lukas and Thorne burst out behind him.

They were in a parking lot. Small, tucked behind a row of trees, the kind of overflow lot that probably only got used during football games. And sitting in the middle of it, engine idling, headlights off, was Lukas's truck.

Gem was behind the wheel, her face pale in the dashboard glow. Benji was in the back seat, laptop closed on his knees, watching the tree line with an intensity Cody had never seen from him before.

Gem saw them coming and her whole body sagged with relief. She didn't say anything, just reached back and shoved the rear door open as they sprinted toward the truck.

They piled in fast. Thorne took the front passenger seat, somehow folding his bulk into the space. Lukas slid into the back with Cody and Benji, pulling the door shut behind him. The doors slammed and Gem had the truck moving before anyone could catch their breath, pulling out of the lot slow and quiet, no lights, gravel crunching under the tires.

Nobody spoke.

The campus slid past the windows, dark buildings and empty paths, and then they were on the road, trees closing in on either side, the headlights finally clicking on as they put distance between themselves and the science building.

Cody sat in the back seat, lungs still heaving, hands shaking. Lukas was pressed against his side, warm and solid, and Cody found himself staring out the window without really seeing anything. They'd come for him. They'd actually come for him. He'd walked into a trap like an idiot and they'd come anyway, busted through guards and broken down doors and followed him into the dark.

Benji shifted beside him, and when Cody glanced over, the hedgehog's face was uncharacteristically serious.

"Pack protects pack," Benji said quietly.

Something cracked in Cody's chest. He tried to respond, tried to find words that would fit the weight of what they'd just done for him, but his throat closed up and his eyes burned and all he could do was dip his head once. He turned toward the window so no one would see his face, watching the road disappear behind them, and let himself breathe for the first time in hours.

The truck's engine hummed as the trees flew past, and somewhere behind them Room B-7 sat empty.
