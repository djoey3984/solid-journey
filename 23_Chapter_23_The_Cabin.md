# Chapter 23: The Cabin

The turnoff was easy to miss if you didn't know where to look. Dirt road, no sign, trees closing in on both sides. Gem took it slow, the truck bouncing over ruts, headlights cutting through the pre-dawn dark. Nobody had said much since they left campus. Thorne was a solid wall of silence in the front passenger seat, and in the back Benji had his laptop closed on his knees with his head tipped against the window. Lukas sat pressed against Cody's side, close enough that their shoulders touched every time the truck hit a bump, but he hadn't said a word since they'd piled in.

Then the trees opened up and there it was.

The cabin sat in a clearing, backed up against a ridge. Single story, wood siding that had weathered to gray, a porch with two chairs that looked like they hadn't been sat in for months. Lukas's dad and uncle had built the place when he was a kid, and even though the Raines family hadn't used it much in the last few years, Lukas still came out to do upkeep every spring. Twenty minutes from campus, far enough to feel like another world.

Gem killed the engine. Out here, silence meant crickets and wind through the pines, and somewhere nearby the faint sound of running water.

Thorne opened his door and the cold rushed in, which was enough to get them moving. Lukas grabbed a bag from the truck bed and headed for the porch, crouching down to pull a key from under the third plank on the left. The door swung open with a creak that echoed in the quiet.

Inside smelled like dust and old wood. Lukas hit the light switch and a single bulb flickered on, casting yellow light across the main room. Not much to see: a couch older than Lukas, worn soft in the middle, a small kitchen along the back wall, a door on the left that led to the bedroom, another to the bathroom. Thorne moved toward the couch and started pulling cushions off to check the frame, already thinking about where everyone would sleep. Benji collapsed into the nearest chair like his strings had been cut. Gem stood in the middle of the room, looking around, then headed for the kitchen and started opening cabinets.

"Not much here," she said, closing the last one. Dust and a few ancient cans. It was the first thing anyone had said in twenty minutes.

Cody stayed near the door, not sure where to put himself. The cabin was safe, he knew that. Off campus, out of Graves's reach, hidden in the county somewhere between Timberwood and nowhere. But his body hadn't caught up yet. His hands still wanted to shake, his chest still tight. Every time he closed his eyes he saw fluorescent lights and felt the cold of that metal table against his back.

"Hey."

Lukas was standing by the bedroom door, one paw braced against the frame. He jerked his head toward the back of the cabin. "Come here a minute."

Cody followed him into a small room with a window facing the trees. A bed with a quilt that looked handmade, a dresser with a lamp on it, nothing else. Lukas closed the door behind them and stood there for a second, not saying anything, just looking at Cody with those amber eyes that always seemed to see more than Cody wanted them to.

"You're an idiot," Lukas said finally.

The word landed like a slap, but Cody didn't flinch. He'd been calling himself worse for hours. "I know."

"You walked right into his office. Alone. After everything we told you."

Cody's chest ached. He could hear the hurt underneath the anger, could see it in the tight line of Lukas's shoulders. "I know."

"He could've killed you." Lukas's voice cracked on the last word, and he turned away, one paw running over his muzzle like he was trying to hold himself together. "He had you strapped to a table, Cody. Do you get that? We didn't know where you were. We didn't know if you were alive. Benji had to hack into a security system older than my truck just to find out which building they'd taken you to, and the whole time I kept thinkin'..." He stopped, shook his head. "Don't matter what I was thinkin'."

"It does matter."

Lukas went still. Cody could see the muscles in his jaw working, the way his paws curled at his sides.

"No, it don't, because you're here now and you're fine and that's what matters." Lukas faced him again, and his eyes were wet but his jaw was set, anger and relief fighting for control of his face. "But you don't get to do that again. You hear me? You don't get to make that call alone. Not anymore."

"He was going to hurt Gem," Cody said. "He was going to take your scholarship. Because of me. Because I'm here."

"So you just handed yourself over? That was your plan?"

"I thought if I went, he'd leave you alone. All of you. I thought..." Cody's throat tightened, and he had to look away. "I thought I was protecting you."

The room went quiet. Outside, a bird started up somewhere in the trees, the first sound of morning. Cody stared at the floor and waited for Lukas to tell him how stupid that was, how naive, how he should have known better.

Instead, Lukas said, "That ain't how this works."

Cody lifted his head.

"You don't get to trade yourself for us," Lukas said. His voice had gone softer, the anger bleeding out of it, leaving something rawer underneath. "That ain't protection. That's just you decidin' you matter less than we do, and that ain't true. You hear me?"

"Lukas..." Cody's voice broke on the name. He wanted to argue, wanted to explain that this was different, that he'd done the math and it made sense at the time. But standing here with Lukas looking at him like that, all he could feel was how wrong he'd been.

"It ain't true." Lukas crossed the room in two steps and grabbed Cody's shoulders, not hard, just firm enough to make him meet his eyes. "You're pack now. That means we protect each other. Not you throwin' yourself on the fire so the rest of us stay warm. That ain't how it works. That ain't ever gonna be how it works."

Part of him wanted to push back. To explain that this was what he did, what he'd always done, that people got hurt when he stuck around too long and leaving first was the only way to keep the damage contained. But the words wouldn't come. His eyes burned and his throat felt like someone had their fist around it, and all he could do was stand there and let Lukas hold him in place.

"Okay," he managed. "Okay."

Lukas's grip loosened, but he didn't let go. For a long moment they just stood there, close enough that Cody could feel the heat coming off Lukas's fur, could hear the steady rhythm of his breathing. Then Lukas leaned forward and pressed his forehead against Cody's, just for a second, a gesture that seemed older than words.

"Get some sleep," Lukas said quietly. "We'll figure out the rest later."

Early morning light was already creeping through the window. In the main room, Cody could hear Thorne settling onto the couch, the old frame groaning under his weight. Benji muttering something as he curled into the armchair. Gem's footsteps padding toward the kitchen table, then stopping.

Lukas pulled back, but not far. "Bed's yours. I'll take the floor."

"Lukas, you don't have to..."

"Ain't askin'." Lukas grabbed a spare blanket from the dresser and dropped it on the worn rug beside the bed. "Go on. Lay down before you fall down."

Cody didn't have the energy to argue. He sat on the edge of the mattress, then let himself tip back onto the handmade quilt. The ceiling was plain white, cracked in one corner. Beside him, he heard Lukas settle onto the floor, the blanket rustling as he got comfortable.

*You're pack now.*

It was such a simple thing to say. Four words. But lying here in the thin morning light, with Lukas's breathing slowing into something like sleep just a few feet away, Cody finally understood what it meant. Not just words. Not just sentiment. These people had broken into a building and fought through guards and followed him into the dark, and they'd done it because he was theirs and they were his and that was just how it worked.

Outside, the birds were getting louder as the sun climbed higher. Somewhere nearby, the creek made a sound like a whisper through the trees.

Cody closed his eyes, and this time the darkness was just darkness, and he let it take him.
