# Chapter 24: What We Carry

Cody woke to the smell of food and the sound of paper crinkling. For a second he didn't know where he was. The ceiling was wrong, the light coming from the wrong direction, and his body ached in places he didn't remember having. Then it came back: the cabin, the extraction, Lukas on the floor beside the bed. The floor was empty now, blanket folded and set on the dresser. He sat up slowly, wincing at the stiffness in his shoulders, and followed the smell out into the main room.

The pack was gathered around the small kitchen table, which was covered in white deli paper and wrapped sandwiches. Thorne was already halfway through something that looked like it weighed about two pounds, and Benji had his laptop open while picking at a bag of chips. Gem sat with a sandwich unwrapped in front of her, making notes in a small notebook. Lukas leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching the door Cody had just come through.

"Sleeping beauty rises," Benji said without looking up.

Cody's stomach growled loud enough that Thorne's ears twitched. He hadn't eaten since lunch with Lukas yesterday, and that felt like it belonged to a different lifetime. "Where'd all this come from?"

"Deli about ten minutes down the road," Gem said. "Thorne made a run while you were out."

Cody looked at the spread: turkey, roast beef, something with peppers. His mouth watered. "You got hoagies?"

Benji's quills twitched. "Hoagies. That's such a coastal thing to say."

"It's what they're called."

"They're called subs. Or sandwiches. Like normal mammals."

"Normal mammals are wrong." Cody grabbed the roast beef and unwrapped it, not bothering to sit down. The first bite hit him harder than he expected, and he had to close his eyes for a second just to remember what real food tasted like.

Lukas moved to stand beside him, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Cody looked up to find those amber eyes watching him, checking. He gave a small nod. *I'm okay. Or I will be.* Lukas's tail did a single slow wag, barely visible, and he turned back to lean against the counter.

They ate. The cabin was quiet except for chewing and the occasional chip bag crinkle. Cody glanced at the kitchen cabinets, which were bare except for dust and a few ancient cans. The deli run made sense. There was nothing here to work with. After a few minutes, Gem set down her pen and turned to Benji. "Show them what you got."

Benji wiped his paws on his jeans and turned the laptop so everyone could see. "Okay, so. You all know I got into the science building's security system. Fifteen-year-old protocols, default passwords, the whole thing's held together with duct tape and wishful thinking." He clicked through a few windows. "But here's the part that matters." The screen showed grainy footage, a timestamp in the corner. A room Cody recognized instantly: beige walls, metal table, that red blinking light in the upper corner that he'd stared at for hours while strapped down and trying not to panic.

"B-7's camera was recording the whole time," Benji said, his voice losing some of its usual bounce. "Everything Graves said to you, Cody. I have all of it."

Cody watched himself on the screen, head turned toward that camera he'd memorized every detail of. Then Graves walked into frame, lab coat crisp, that patient smile already in place. The audio crackled but came through clear enough.


His sandwich turned to chalk in his mouth. He set it down. The room went still as the recording played. Cody couldn't look at the others, so he stared at the wood grain of the table while his own voice came through the speakers, thin and scared, asking questions that got calm non-answers. When Graves mentioned TH-2010-003, the female subject who lasted three days, Gem made a soft sound. When he talked about journals begging to print his name, Thorne's claws scraped against the table.

The footage ended. Benji closed the laptop carefully, like it might bite him. For a long moment nobody spoke.

"I cut the feed before Lukas and Thorne went in," Benji said finally. "Guards never saw the extraction. As far as Graves knows, you just vanished."

Gem was leaning forward now, that sharp focus Cody had seen before locked onto the closed laptop. Her tail had gone completely still. "Benji. That footage. It's timestamped?"

"Yeah. Date, time, location metadata. The whole thing."

"And it shows his face clearly? His voice is identifiable?"

"Crystal clear. Old camera, but decent quality."

Gem sat back, recognition crossing her face like a puzzle piece clicking into place. "That's not just evidence," she said slowly. "That's a confession. Recorded. Timestamped. On university equipment, in a university building, showing a dean admitting to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment." She glanced around the table, and for the first time since Cody had met her, Gem Kindler was almost smiling. "That's how we take him down."

Another silence settled over the table, but this one felt different. Charged instead of heavy. Then Benji's laptop made a sharp beeping sound, and he flinched hard enough to knock his chips off the table. "Shit." He grabbed for the computer, paws fumbling. "Shit, shit, come on..."

"What?" Gem's voice went sharp.

"Nothing, it's fine, just..." Benji's paws were shaking as he typed. The screen flickered, went dark, came back with an error message. "No. No no no, not now." He kept typing, faster, more frantic. The error message multiplied, cascading across the screen.

"Benji." Gem again, harder this time. "What's happening?"

"I don't know! It was fine, it was working, everything was backed up and now it's just..." He slammed his paw against the table hard enough to make the sandwiches jump. "Come ON!" The outburst hung in the air. Benji stared at the screen, shoulders hunched, breathing hard. Then all the fight drained out of him at once and he slumped back, paws over his face. "Sorry," he said, muffled. "Sorry, I just... I can't be the reason this doesn't work."

"It's probably just a glitch," Gem said. "We can fix it."

"It's not about the glitch." Benji dropped his paws. His eyes were wet. "It's about... okay, this is going to sound stupid, but I've never had this before? Like, any of this?" He gestured vaguely at the room, at all of them, his quills flattening against his head in a way Cody hadn't seen before. "People who actually show up," he continued, the words coming faster now. "People who stick around when things get hard. My whole life it's been backup plans and exit strategies because everyone leaves eventually, right? That's just how it works. You learn not to count on anyone because counting on people is how you end up alone at three AM wondering what you did wrong this time." He let out a shaky breath. "But then there's this. You guys. And it's real, and it matters, and I keep waiting for the part where it falls apart. Where I mess something up and everyone disappears. And if I screw up this one thing, this one important thing, maybe that's when it happens. Maybe that's the reason everyone finally..."

He couldn't finish. Thorne reached over and put one massive paw on Benji's shoulder, steady and solid, not saying anything.

Cody's throat tightened. He didn't know Benji well, not really, but he knew that math. He'd done it himself more times than he could count.

"You're not going to screw it up," Gem said, her voice softer than Cody had heard it before. "And even if something goes wrong, we figure it out together. That's the whole point."

Benji nodded, wiping at his eyes with the back of his paw. "Yeah. I know. I know that, I just..." He let out a shaky laugh. "Wow, okay, that was way more feelings than I planned for a Thursday. Can we pretend I said something clever instead? I have a reputation to maintain."

"We know," Lukas said quietly from the counter. "We all know." The laptop screen flickered again, then stabilized. The error messages cleared.

"See?" Benji's voice was still rough, but steadier. "Just a glitch."

"Just a glitch," Gem agreed.

But the room felt different now. Cody could see it in the way Thorne's paw lingered on Benji's shoulder before pulling back. In the way Gem was looking at the hedgehog without her usual clinical edge. In the way Lukas had gone still, arms crossed, watching Benji with that same protective focus he usually saved for Cody. A wall had come down. Not a big one, maybe, but enough to let some light through.


They took a break after that. Cody stepped outside to clear his head, leaning against the porch railing and watching the trees sway in the afternoon breeze. The creek was louder out here, a constant murmur underneath the wind.

The door opened behind him. Gem came out, notebook still tucked under one arm, and leaned against the railing beside him.

"You holding up okay?" she asked.

Cody shrugged. "Weird question to answer. I'm not strapped to a table anymore, so that's an improvement."

"Low bar." The corner of her mouth twitched, not quite a smile but close.

"It's the one I've got." He glanced over at her. "What about you? You've been scribbling in that notebook since we got here."

Gem's ears twitched. "Habit. When things get complicated, I make lists. Helps me feel like I have some control over the chaos." She tapped the notebook against the railing. "Probably looks neurotic from the outside."

"Looks like someone who's trying to keep track of a lot of moving pieces."

"That's a generous read." She was quiet for a moment, watching the tree line. When she spoke again, her voice had shifted, gone softer. "I couldn't save someone once. That's why I am the way I am. The patterns, the data, the obsessive checking. It started because I missed something I should have caught."

Cody waited. Gave her the space to find her own way into it, the same way she'd given Benji space ten minutes ago.

"Freshman year." Gem's grip on the notebook had gone white-knuckled. "There was a girl in my cohort, a vole named Petra. Sharp mind, good instincts, working on cross-dimensional energy signatures. Her advisor was this professor, big name in the department, lots of publications." Her mouth twisted. "He stole her work. Published it under his name, claimed she was just a lab assistant who'd misremembered her contributions."

Cody's hands curled around the railing. He thought about Graves in that lab coat, that patient smile, all that calm certainty while he explained how Cody was going to make history. "Damn."

"I saw pieces of it happening," Gem said. "Little things. The way he'd dismiss her ideas in meetings and then bring them up later as his own. The way her name kept sliding off drafts. The way she started flinching when he walked into the lab." She shook her head. "I had all the data points, Cody. Every single one. But I didn't connect them fast enough. By the time I figured out what was happening, she'd already gone to administration."

"What did they do?"

"Buried it." Gem's tail flicked once, sharp. "Called it a misunderstanding. Suggested she might be struggling with the pressure of graduate work. The professor kept his position, kept his grants, kept his reputation. Petra transferred out a month later. I never heard from her again."

Cody thought about that. A girl with a sharp mind and good instincts, ground down by someone with more power and better connections. A system that protected the wrong people because protecting them was easier than asking hard questions. His chest ached, and he wasn't sure if it was for Petra or for himself.

"So now you build the patterns before they finish forming," he said quietly.

Gem nodded. "I track the data before it goes missing. I make sure that if someone's being hurt, I see it coming in time to actually do something about it." She finally met his gaze, and the exhaustion in her face was the same kind he saw in the mirror. "Petra was the first person I failed to protect. I made myself a promise after she left. Never again."

The name Graves sat heavy in Cody's throat. He remembered Gem in that basement, the day she'd tested him. The way she'd kept her voice lower than necessary, positioned them in a corner where the camera couldn't reach. He hadn't understood it then. He was starting to now.

"Thank you," he said finally. "For catching it this time."

Gem's smile was small but real. "Thank me after tomorrow. We've still got a Dean to destroy." She paused at the door, looking back. "And Cody? I'm glad you're here. Even if the circumstances are terrible."

She went back inside, and Cody stayed on the porch, watching the trees bend and straighten in the wind. He thought about his own weight, the thing he'd been carrying since before he fell through a portal into a world that shouldn't exist. Sooner or later they were going to ask. Sooner or later he was going to have to decide whether to answer.

The wind picked up again, cold against his face, and Cody stayed where he was, letting it push against him while he tried to figure out what he was willing to let go.


The planning session lasted most of the afternoon.

They gathered back around the kitchen table, sandwiches pushed aside to make room for Benji's laptop and Gem's notebook. The footage sat on the screen like a loaded weapon, paused on Graves's face mid-sentence.

"The problem," Gem said, "is that official channels won't help us. Graves has fifteen years of institutional protection. Connections to the board, donors, everyone who matters. We take this to administration, it gets buried. Police means months of investigation, and he has plenty of time to destroy evidence and control the narrative."

"So we skip the middlemen," Benji said, drumming his claws on the table. "Go straight to the people." His eyes lit up the way they did when he was three steps ahead of everyone else. "Game Day. Forty thousand mammals in one place, half the state watching on TV. We put that footage on the Jumbotron and let them all see exactly what kind of Dean they've been cheering for."

Gem leaned forward, running the numbers in her head. "That's... actually not insane. Media presence, witnesses everywhere, no way to spin it quietly. By the time he could even try damage control, the story's already out."

"Benji, can you actually do it?" Lukas asked. "The PA system, the screens, all of it?"

"Stadium IT is somehow worse than the science building," Benji said with a grin that was half manic, half proud. "I could probably run the whole system from my phone if I wanted to. The hard part isn't getting in. It's timing it right so nobody cuts the feed before the good stuff plays."

"Halftime," Thorne said. Everyone looked at him. "Biggest crowd attention. Everyone's watching the field, waiting for the show. Nobody's expecting the real show to be on the screens."

Gem nodded. "That's our window. Lukas and Thorne are on the field for the first half anyway, so we can't move before that. Cody, Benji, and I position in the stands. At halftime, we slip backstage. Benji handles the tech, I run interference if needed."

She paused, pen hovering over her notebook, and turned to Cody. "And you make the speech."

Cody blinked. "Wait, me? Why me?"

"Because you're the victim," Gem said, not unkindly. "You're the one he strapped to a table. You're the one with the bruises and the story. A recording is powerful, but a face standing in front of forty thousand people saying 'this happened to me' is something else entirely."

"She's right," Lukas said quietly. His amber eyes were steady on Cody's face. "People need someone to believe in. Someone real, standin' there, tellin' the truth. That's you."

Thorne nodded. "Footage alone, they might think it's fake. Edited. You standing there makes it real."

Cody looked around the table. They were all watching him, waiting, no pressure in their faces. They were offering him a role that mattered. A chance to be more than just the guy things happened to.

"Okay," he said slowly. "Okay, I'll do it."

The tension in the room eased. Benji let out a breath. Gem made a note in her notebook.

"But I have a condition," Cody added.

Lukas's ears flicked forward. "What kind of condition?"

"Before halftime. Before any of this." Cody's hands were flat on the table, steadying himself. "I want to face him."

The room went still.

"Why?" Gem asked carefully.

"Because he made me feel like nothing." Cody's voice was steady, but anger threaded through it, building since he woke up in that cabin. "Like I was just a thing to be studied. A specimen. And I want to look him in the eye and show him that I'm still here. That I'm not afraid of him anymore."

"That's a risk," Gem said. "If he knows you're there, he might..."

"He won't do anything," Cody cut in. "Not if I do it right. The concourse, ten or fifteen minutes before kickoff. He'll be doing the rounds, pressing flesh, working the crowd. I walk up to him in front of everyone, smile, say something innocent. Nice day for football, something like that. He can't touch me. Can't even react without looking crazy."

"And if he does react?" Lukas asked, wariness creeping into his voice.

"Then we have even more witnesses." Cody leaned forward. "I'm not trying to provoke him into something stupid. I just want him to know. Before the footage plays, before his whole world falls apart, I want him to look at me and see that I'm not broken. That whatever he tried to do to me didn't work."

Gem considered this, tapping her pen against the notebook. "If he's rattled when the footage drops, he's more likely to crack publicly instead of keeping his composure." She glanced at the others. "It could actually help."

Thorne shrugged. "His choice. His risk."

Benji was grinning. "I love it. Psychological warfare. Very dramatic."

Lukas was the last to speak. His posture was tense, shoulders tight, but when he met Cody's eyes, the worry there gave way to reluctant respect. "You sure about this?"

"I'm sure."

A long pause. Then Lukas nodded. "Alright. We do it your way."

The plan was set. Benji started pulling up stadium schematics on his laptop, muttering about access points and signal boosters. Gem made lists, her handwriting small and precise. Thorne leaned back, arms crossed, watching everything with that steady focus he brought to everything.

And Cody sat there, feeling for the first time since Room B-7 like he might actually have a say in how this story ended.


The planning wound down around four, and for a while nobody knew what to do with the silence. The cabin felt different without a crisis to fill it, smaller, more real.

Benji found a deck of cards in one of the kitchen drawers, warped and sticky from humidity but still usable. "Poker?" he offered, fanning them out. "I promise I only cheat a little."

"You cheat a lot," Gem said, but she pulled up a chair anyway.

They played for chips from the bag Benji had been working through all day, which meant the stakes were literally just crumbs. Thorne won three hands in a row with a face so blank it could have been carved from stone. Benji accused him of counting cards. Thorne pointed out that you couldn't count cards in poker. Benji accused him of cheating anyway.

"He's not cheating," Gem said, tossing her cards down. "He just has the worst poker face in history, and somehow that makes him impossible to read. It's statistically infuriating."

"I'll take it," Thorne rumbled, raking in his pile of crumbs.

Lukas sat out the first few rounds, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, but Cody caught him watching the game with a half-smile he was trying to hide. After a while he pushed off and dropped into the chair next to Cody. "Deal me in."

"You any good?" Cody asked.

"Terrible." Lukas's tail wagged once. "But I like watchin' Benji lose."

"Hey!" Benji threw a chip at him. It bounced off Lukas's chest and landed on the floor. "I'm not losing, I'm strategically redistributing my assets."

The game continued. Cody lost badly, which he blamed on never having played poker with people who had ears that swiveled and tails that twitched. Benji insisted that was speciesist. Gem pointed out that Cody also just had a terrible poker face. "You do this thing with your eyebrows when you're bluffing," she said. "It's very obvious."

"I don't have a thing with my eyebrows." Cody raised both of them as high as they would go, holding the expression for a beat. "See? Completely normal."

Lukas snorted. "You absolutely do. It's kind of cute."

Cody felt his face heat and focused very hard on his cards.

The afternoon stretched into early evening, the light through the windows going gold and then orange. At some point Thorne got up and started rummaging through the kitchen cabinets, emerging with a can of beans and a dented pot that looked older than all of them combined.

"Dinner?" he offered.

"I'm not eating mystery beans the night before we take down a dean," Benji said. "What if we all get food poisoning?"

Gem was already on her phone. "There's a pizza place about twenty minutes out that delivers. We're off the grid enough, should be fine."

Two large pepperonis and a veggie later, they ate pizza out of the box, sitting around the table that was still covered in chip crumbs and scattered cards. It should have felt pathetic, five people hiding in a cabin eating delivery pizza while they planned to take down a corrupt dean. But it didn't. It felt like the family dinners Cody had stopped hoping for years ago. It felt like belonging.

After dinner, Lukas caught his eye and tilted his head toward the back door. Cody followed him out onto the small deck that overlooked the creek, the water catching the last of the sunset in flashes of copper and pink.

They stood there for a while, shoulders almost touching, listening to the water move.

"You doin' okay?" Lukas asked. "Real answer, not the one you give everyone else."

Cody thought about it. "I don't know," he said finally. "I keep waiting to feel something. Fear, anger, I don't know. But mostly I just feel tired."

"That's fair. You've earned tired."

Cody's mouth twisted, something between a grimace and a smile that didn't quite land. "Have I?"

Lukas turned to look at him, amber eyes catching the fading light. "You got kidnapped, strapped to a table, threatened, escaped, and now you're plannin' to walk up to the guy who did it and smile in his face. Yeah, Cody. You've earned tired."

Cody let out a breath that was almost a laugh. "When you put it like that."

"I put it like that 'cause it's true." Lukas's paw found his, warm and solid. "You don't gotta be brave all the time. Not with me."

"I'm not being brave. I'm just too worn out to be scared."

"Same thing, sometimes."

The creek kept moving, catching light and losing it. Somewhere inside, Benji was arguing with Gem about the proper way to shuffle cards. Thorne's low rumble cut in occasionally, settling disputes with single words.

Cody leaned into Lukas's shoulder, just a little. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For this. All of it. The pack, the cabin, the cheap pizza." He paused. "For not giving up on me when I made it really easy to."

Lukas squeezed his hand. "Wasn't ever gonna happen."

They stayed like that until the sun finished setting and the stars started coming out. Lukas's thumb traced slow circles on the back of Cody's hand, steady and unhurried, and Cody found himself thinking that maybe, when all this was over, there might be something worth staying for beyond just survival.

For a few minutes, the weight he'd been carrying felt almost manageable.


Evening settled over the cabin. The pizza boxes were stacked by the door, the cards put away, and the pack had drifted into their own corners. Benji was back on his laptop, running diagnostics. Gem had her notebook open, refining tomorrow's timeline. Lukas had gone to check on the truck, make sure it would start in the morning.

Cody found Thorne on the front porch, sitting in one of the old wooden chairs that creaked under his weight. The bear was staring out at the tree line, paws resting on his knees, taped knuckles catching the last of the light.

"Mind if I sit?" Cody asked.

Thorne tilted his head toward the empty chair. Permission granted.

They sat in silence for a while. Cody had learned by now that pushing Thorne was pointless. The bear talked when he was ready, and not a second before. So Cody watched the trees instead, listened to the creek, let the stillness stretch between them until it felt natural rather than awkward.

"You ever lose someone?" Thorne asked eventually. His voice was low, almost lost under the sound of the water.

Cody thought about his mother, the slow fade of her smile as the cancer took hold. "Yeah."

Thorne nodded, like that was the answer he'd expected. He was quiet for another long moment, and when he spoke again, his words came deliberate, each one placed like a stone in a wall.

"My dad left when I was twelve. Didn't say goodbye, didn't leave a note. Just gone one morning, like he'd never been there at all." His massive shoulders rose and fell. "Mom never talked about it. I never asked. Figured if she wanted me to know, she'd tell me."

Cody felt the weight of that settle over him. He thought about his own father, the bottles, the silence, the way absence could fill a room just as heavy as presence.

"I'm sorry," he said. The words sounded small, but they were the only ones he had.

"Spent a lot of years thinking it was my fault." Thorne's voice stayed even, but his claws had dug shallow grooves into the arm of the chair. "Thinking if I was stronger, bigger, maybe I could have made him stay. Could have held on tight enough that he couldn't leave."

"Thorne..." Cody's chest ached. He'd watched the bear move through the world like nothing could touch him, seen the way other mammals stepped aside when he walked past. To hear him talk about not being strong enough was wrong, like finding out a mountain had doubts about being tall.

"Doesn't work that way." Thorne finally looked at him, and the weariness in those dark eyes looked like it had been living there a long time. "Can't hold onto someone who wants to leave. Doesn't matter how strong you are. That's not what strength is for."

The creek kept murmuring. Somewhere in the cabin, Benji's laptop beeped twice.

"I watched that footage today," Thorne said. "The stuff Benji pulled. Graves standing over you, talking about his research, his history." His claws flexed against his knee. "Talking about that girl who lasted three days."

Cody's stomach tightened. He remembered those hours on that table, Graves's patient smile, the monologue that went on and on while Cody catalogued every detail of the room, looking for a way out.

"You didn't panic." Thorne's voice was simple, factual. "He had you strapped down, alone, telling you what he was going to do. And you just... watched. Waited. Stayed calm enough to find a way out."

"I wasn't calm. I was terrified."

"Doesn't matter. Terror makes people beg. Makes them scream, thrash, give up." Thorne shook his head slowly. "You kept your head. That's not nothing."

Cody didn't know what to say. He'd spent those hours cataloguing door timing and camera angles because it was the only thing keeping him from screaming. It hadn't felt like strength. It had been the only option that wasn't falling apart.

"That's what pack means," Thorne said. "You don't hold on too tight. You just show up. Over and over. Until showing up is the same as staying."

The door opened behind them. Lukas stepped out, saw them sitting there, and hesitated.

"You two okay?"

Thorne stood, joints popping. "Fine. Just talking." He moved past Lukas into the cabin, one massive paw briefly squeezing the wolf's shoulder as he passed.

Lukas took the empty chair, and the silence between them was different than the one with Thorne. Heavier. Cody could feel things unspoken pressing at the edges.


For a while, neither of them said anything. The creek filled the space, and somewhere inside the cabin Benji was laughing at something Gem had said. Normal sounds. Safe sounds.

"You and Thorne have a good talk?" Lukas asked finally.

"Yeah." Cody glanced at him. "He's not what I expected."

"Nobody ever is." Lukas's tail brushed against the porch boards, slow and rhythmic. "First time I met him, I thought he was gonna eat me. Turns out he just wanted to know if I had any snacks."

Cody laughed, short and surprised. "Seriously?"

"Hand to God. Big scary bear, askin' if I had any granola bars." Lukas shook his head, a small smile tugging at his muzzle. "Benji was worse. Tried to prank me with hot sauce on my first day. Didn't know wolves could smell capsaicin from across the room."

"So you've always been this paranoid."

"Cautious. There's a difference."

They sat with that for a moment. The stars were fully out now, scattered across the sky like someone had spilled salt on black velvet.

"I just..." Lukas ran a paw over his muzzle. "Someone taught me, once. To look out for people. To pay attention to back routes and safe paths and ways to keep the people you care about from getting hurt. And I've been doing it so long I forgot there's a difference between helping and hovering."

"Who taught you?"

Lukas didn't answer right away. His ears flicked back, then forward again. "Guy named Marcus. Older player, three years ahead of me. When I was a freshman, he took me under his wing. Showed me the ropes, covered for me when upperclassmen got territorial, taught me where the cameras were and which routes to take and how to survive this place." A pause. "He graduated. Moved on. Life happened. Haven't heard from him in years."

"And that's why you helped me."

"He did it for me. Felt right to pass it on." Lukas finally met his eyes. "Difference is, I'm not going anywhere. But that doesn't mean I get to decide how you fight your own battles. I know that. I do. It's just hard to turn off."

The tension in Cody's shoulders eased, just a little. "So this is you trying to turn it off?"

"This is me tryin' to figure out where the line is." Lukas's drawl thickened, the way it did when he was fighting to stay calm. "I know what I said earlier, in front of everyone. About the speech. I meant that. You're the right one to do it." He paused. "But the confrontation. Walkin' up to Graves before we drop the footage... I've been thinkin', and that's a risk I ain't comfortable with."

"You agreed to it."

"I got caught up in the moment. Everyone was there, you were fired up, and I wanted to support you." Lukas leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "But I've had time to think now. And Graves had you strapped to a table, Cody. He talked about keepin' you there for days. You wanna walk up to him with a smile and poke the bear?"

"I want him to see that I'm not afraid."

"But you are afraid. We all are. That's not weakness, that's sense." Lukas shook his head, ears pinning back. Lukas shook his head, ears flattening. "And pretendin' otherwise is how people get hurt."

Cody felt something coiling tight behind his ribs, that familiar pressure that always came before he did something stupid. "So what, I just hide until halftime? Let him think he won?"

"Nobody's talkin' about hidin'. I'm talkin' about not givin' him a heads up that we're comin' for him."

"He already knows we're coming for him!" Cody was on his feet now, pacing the small porch. "He knows I escaped, he knows the pack helped, he knows we have something planned. The only thing he doesn't know is when and how. Walking up to him doesn't change that."

"It changes everything!" Lukas stood too, and for a moment they were face to face, close enough that Cody could see the worry lines between his eyes. "You get in his face, he starts thinkin'. Starts plannin'. Maybe he pulls extra security, maybe he doesn't show up to the concourse at all. You're gamblin' the whole operation on a moment of satisfaction."

"It's not about satisfaction!"

"Then what's it about?" Lukas's voice cracked, just slightly. "Because from where I'm standin', it looks like you're tryin' to prove somethin' to yourself, and you're willin' to risk everything to do it."

The words hit harder than Cody expected. He stopped pacing, breathing hard, and for a moment all he could hear was his own heartbeat and the distant sound of the creek.

"You don't know what it was like," he said finally. His voice came out rough. "Being strapped down. Listening to him talk about me like I was already dead. Like I was just... a thing."

"I know." Lukas's voice softened. "I saw the footage, remember? I watched him standin' over you while you couldn't move."

"Then you know why I need to do this." Cody's eyes scrunched shut for a moment, jaw tight.

"What I know is that you're angry. And scared. And you're not thinkin' straight." Lukas took a step closer, and his paw landed on Cody's shoulder, warm and solid. "I've seen you when you get like this. The way you go quiet right before you blow up. You get hot, and you stop seein' the bigger picture."

Cody's hands were shaking now, that old familiar anger looking for somewhere to go.

"You don't know anything about me."

"Then tell me." Lukas's eyes held his, steady and patient. "Tell me what's really goin' on. Because this ain't just about Graves. This is about somethin' older."

The words hit too close. Cody felt a wall crack open in his chest, and behind it was heat, too much heat, clawing at his ribs like it wanted out.

"You don't get to do that." His voice came out wrong, shaking. "You don't get to dig around in my head and pretend you know what's in there."

"Cody, wait..."

"No." He stepped back, shaking Lukas's paw off his shoulder. The heat was spreading now, down his arms, into his hands. Wrong. This was wrong. "You want to know what's really going on? You want to know what I'm carrying? You're not ready for that. None of you are."

He couldn't breathe. The porch was too small and Lukas was too close and the thing inside him was clawing at his ribs like it wanted out.

He yanked open the cabin door and went inside.


The main room went still when Cody walked in.

Thorne lifted his head from the couch. Benji glanced up from his laptop. Gem emerged from the kitchen area, wiping her hands on her jeans. They all saw his face and nobody said a word.

Cody made it halfway across the room before his legs stopped working. He stood there shaking, pressure building behind his ribs until it twisted into panic.

Behind him, the porch door opened. "He needs to sit down," Lukas called out, his voice tight. "Now."

Gem moved without hesitation, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table. The gesture said everything without a word. Cody's feet carried him to it without his permission. He sat down heavily, put his elbows on the table, pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. The others gathered around him, settling into chairs, moving without crowding. Giving him space. Giving him time.

"I know about the girl you couldn't save," Cody said to his hands, the words coming out jagged, each one dragged up from somewhere deep. "I know about Benji waiting for everyone to leave. I know about Thorne's dad and Lukas's mentor who taught him to look out for people." He dropped his hands and met their eyes, one by one, jaw set, that pressure still coiled behind his ribs. "You want to know about me? Fine. You want to know what I'm carrying? I'll tell you."

Benji's quills flattened against his head. Thorne went very still. Gem's pen had stopped moving over her notebook, her ears angled forward. Lukas stood behind Cody's chair, close enough that Cody could feel the warmth of him.

"There was a guy," Cody started. His voice came out rough, like something rusted that hadn't been used in too long. "Back home. Senior year. Football teammate. Running back, same as me. We'd been competing for the starting spot all season, and he got it. I was backup. Told myself I was fine with it."

The memory was right there, vivid as a photograph. The locker room before the big game. The fluorescent lights. The smell of sweat and industrial cleaner. Guys suiting up all around them, coaches yelling about formations.

"My mom died when I was twelve. Cancer. Took about eight months from diagnosis to the end, and I watched the whole thing." Cody's hands curled on the table. "This guy, he knew. Everyone knew. Small town, word gets around."

His grip tightened. The wood of the table creaked under his fingers.

"He started talking. Loud enough for everyone to hear. About my mom. About what he'd do to her if she was still alive. The things he'd make her do." Cody's voice went flat, dead. "Detailed. Graphic. Smiling the whole time, watching my face, waiting to see what I'd do."

The room was so silent Cody could hear the creek outside, could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.

"I asked him to stop. Once. He laughed and kept going." Cody exhaled slowly. "So I stopped asking."

He could feel their eyes on him. Could feel the pressure building behind his ribs, that familiar weight, that thing that had been growing since he fell through the portal.

"I don't remember most of it. I remember the first punch. I remember him going down. And then it was just red. Noise and heat and my fists hitting something over and over until I couldn't feel my hands anymore."

His voice cracked.

"They had to pull me off. Three guys, maybe four. I don't know. I was still swinging when they dragged me away." His gaze dropped to his hands, to the white knuckles, to the way they were shaking. "They said if they hadn't stopped me, I would have killed him. And the thing is..." He swallowed hard. "The thing is, I believe them. I wasn't stopping. I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop."

The heat was building now, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. He could feel his fingers pressing harder into the table, could feel the wood groaning, could feel something shifting under his skin that shouldn't be there.

"He was in the hospital for two weeks. Broken jaw, broken orbital, broken ribs. I got expelled. Dad had to pay off the family to keep me out of juvie." A bitter laugh escaped him. "Didn't matter. Word got around. Schools wouldn't take me, teams wouldn't touch me. I was done."

Lukas reached across and put his paw over Cody's hands. 

Cody shrugged it off. "Don't!"

Lukas came around the chair and crouched in front of him, both paws gripping Cody's shoulders, solid and warm. "Cody. Look at me."

He couldn't. If he looked up, they'd see. They'd see whatever was happening to him, whatever was wrong with him, whatever that portal had woken up or created or unleashed.

"Cody!" Lukas's grip tightened, trying to shake something loose. "Look at me!"

Cody kept his head down, eyes squeezed shut.

Lukas's paw came up under his chin, gentle but firm, lifting until Cody had no choice but to meet those amber eyes. They were steady, holding neither fear nor judgment, just that patient, stubborn care that had been there since that first day in the pine grove.

"Hey." Lukas's voice dropped, soft now. "Hey, Cody. That's what you did. It ain't who you are."

Cody's throat closed up. His eyes burned.

Gem's certain voice softly spoke up. "Tomorrow you use words. That's who you're choosing to be. That matters more."

Thorne spoke without looking up from his hands. "He said that about your mother. I understand."

Benji was watching with wet eyes, chin trembling, but he didn't look away.

A wall cracked in Cody's chest. Not the heat this time, not the anger. The thing underneath it, the thing he'd been holding together with wire and spite for years.

The tears came before he could stop them. He reached forward and grabbed Lukas, pulling him into a hug that was probably too tight, burying his face against the wolf's shoulder. Lukas didn't hesitate, wrapping his arms around Cody and holding on like he was the only thing keeping him from falling apart.

Maybe he was.

They stayed like that for a long moment, Cody's shoulders shaking, Lukas's paw steady on the back of his head. The others didn't move, didn't speak, just let it happen.

Finally, Cody pulled back, wiping his face with the back of his hand. He stared down at his fingers, the same fingers that had broken bones and ruined a life, the same hands that had wanted to keep swinging until there was nothing left to hit.

Lukas reached over and wrapped both paws around them, holding them steady.

"I don't know what's happening to me," Cody whispered. "Since I got here. There's something... I can feel it. Getting stronger."

Lukas squeezed his hands. "We'll figure it out. After tomorrow. Together."

Then he pulled Cody into another hug, and this time Cody let himself sink into it. Let himself believe, just for a second, that he wasn't alone anymore. That pack meant something. That together wasn't just a word.

When they finally separated, the others had moved closer. Thorne's massive paw landed briefly on Cody's shoulder. Benji gave him a watery smile. Gem reached across and squeezed his arm, just once.

The night settled around them, quiet and full of everything tomorrow would bring. But sitting there at that table, surrounded by people who knew the worst thing he'd ever done and had chosen to stay anyway, Cody felt a warmth in his chest that had nothing to do with anger.

Hope.
