# Chapter 25: Before the Roar

Friday morning came through the cabin windows soft and slow. Cody blinked awake, aware of warmth along his back before anything else. The bed was small, barely a full, and sometime during the night Lukas had shifted closer. His arm was draped loosely over Cody's side, his breath slow and even against the back of Cody's neck.

For a few seconds, Cody didn't move. Just lay there, letting himself have this one quiet moment before everything started.

Through the open bedroom door, he could see the main room. Thorne was up, folding the blanket from the couch. Two sleeping bags lay empty near the cold fireplace. Benji sat cross-legged on his, laptop balanced on one knee, and Gem stood at the window with her arms crossed, watching the trees.

Behind him, Lukas stirred. The arm around Cody's waist tightened briefly, then relaxed.

"You awake?" Lukas's voice was rough with sleep.

"Yeah." Cody watched Thorne open a cabinet, stare into it, and close it again. The cabin didn't have much. "We should find food."

"Diner on the way in. Saw it when we drove up."

From the main room, Benji's voice cut through. "If this diner doesn't have coffee, I'm going to do something dramatic. I haven't decided what yet, but it'll be memorable."

"You'll survive," Gem said without turning from the window.

"I won't. I'll die. You'll have to explain to everyone that Benji Hartwell perished from caffeine withdrawal on the most important day of his life."

Cody felt Lukas's chest shake with a quiet laugh. He made himself sit up, already missing the warmth, and went to find his shoes.

It didn't take long to get ready. Nobody had much to pack. Benji shoved his laptop into his bag, Gem did a final sweep of the cabin to make sure they weren't leaving anything behind, and Thorne stood by the door like he was ready to physically carry anyone who moved too slow. Cody splashed water on his face in the tiny bathroom, stared at himself in the mirror for three seconds, and decided that was enough self-reflection for a morning like this.

They piled into Gem's car, Thorne folding himself into the back seat with a look of resigned suffering. The gravel crunched under the tires as they pulled away from the cabin, and Cody watched it shrink in the side mirror until the trees swallowed it up. Nobody suggested stopping at the deli from yesterday. They all wanted something different, something that didn't remind them of hiding.

Lukas spotted the diner about twenty minutes down the road, tucked between a gas station and a bait shop that looked like it hadn't seen a customer in years. The sign out front said ROSIE'S in letters that used to be red, now faded to something closer to salmon. A pickup truck and a station wagon sat in the gravel lot, both covered in a fine layer of dust.

"This looks like the kind of place that either has the best pancakes you've ever tasted or gives you food poisoning," Benji announced as Gem pulled into a spot. "No middle ground."

"Fifty-fifty odds," Thorne said from the back seat, where he'd spent the drive with his knees practically in his chest. "I'll take 'em."

The bell above the door jingled when they walked in. The inside matched the outside: worn linoleum, booths with cracked vinyl seats, a counter with red stools that had seen better decades. The smell hit Cody immediately, bacon grease and coffee and something sweet baking in the back. His stomach growled before he could stop it.

A tired-looking raccoon behind the counter looked up, did a quick headcount, and nodded toward the back corner. "Booth in the back'll fit you. Menus are on the table."

They squeezed in. Thorne took up most of one side, his shoulders pressing against the wall. Gem slid in next to him, tail curling around her feet. Cody ended up between Lukas and Benji, close enough that he could feel the warmth of Lukas's leg against his.

Benji grabbed a menu and started scanning it like he was looking for contraband. "They have something called a Lumberjack Special. Three eggs, four strips of bacon, two sausage links, hash browns, and a short stack. That's not breakfast, that's a challenge."

"That's Tuesday," Thorne said, not looking up from his own menu.

"I'm getting it." Benji slapped the menu down. "If I die, tell my laptop I loved it."

The raccoon waitress appeared with a pot of coffee and a pad, looking like she'd seen every type of customer walk through that door and stopped being surprised years ago.

Benji's eyes locked onto the coffee pot like she was carrying liquid gold. "Oh thank god. Yes. Please. Fill it to the brim. I will name my firstborn after you."

The waitress didn't blink. "It's just coffee, hon."

"It's *salvation*."

She poured, unimpressed, and pulled out her pad. They ordered. Thorne got the Lumberjack Special too, plus a side of biscuits. Gem asked for eggs and toast, practical as always. Lukas just wanted coffee and some wheat toast. Cody stared at the menu for too long before settling on scrambled eggs and bacon, his stomach too knotted to commit to anything heavier.

When the waitress left, Benji wrapped both paws around his mug like it might try to escape. "So. Game day. You know the stadium's gonna be packed, right? Like, standing room only. They've been hyping this game for weeks."

"It's the playoff decider," Lukas said. "Course it's packed."

"Right, right." Benji took a long sip, then pointed the mug at him. "And you're gonna be out there, doing your whole linebacker thing, looking scary. Meanwhile I'm gonna be in the stands, sweating through my hoodie, pretending I'm not about to..."

He caught himself, glanced around the diner. Empty except for an old badger at the counter nursing his own coffee.

"Pretending I'm not nervous," he finished. "About the game. Because sports."

"Smooth," Gem said.

Silence settled over the table for a moment. Cody could feel the tension underneath everything, the thing none of them wanted to name out loud. They'd talked it to death last night. They knew the plan. Saying it again wouldn't make it any more real.

Gem's pencil tapped against the table twice, then stopped. "So Thorne. You ever eat at a place like this before a game?"

Thorne considered the question like it had actual weight. "Once. Sophomore year. Ate a western omelet the size of my head, then threw up behind the bleachers during warmups." He paused. "Still played the whole game though."

"That's disgusting," Benji said, delighted. "I love it. Tell me more."

And just like that, the tension cracked. Thorne started talking about the game, the one against Ridgewood's rival two years back, how their center had tried to start a fight and ended up flat on his back wondering what happened. Benji interrupted every thirty seconds with questions and commentary. Gem's mouth twitched in that almost-smile she did when she was actually enjoying herself but didn't want to admit it.

The food arrived. Benji stared at his Lumberjack Special like it had personally offended him, then picked up his fork with the determination of a man going into battle. Thorne demolished his plate with methodical efficiency. Gem ate her eggs in small, precise bites, watching the rest of them with quiet amusement.

Cody picked at his bacon. Lukas's paw found his knee under the table, squeezed once, then stayed there.

"You know what I've been thinking about?" Benji said around a mouthful of hash browns. "That time Thorne got stuck in the elevator in Whitmore. You remember that? Security had to call maintenance, and he just sat in there for like two hours reading a book."

"It was forty-five minutes," Thorne said.

"It was two hours and you finished the whole book."

"It was a short book."

"It was like eight hundred pages!"

Gem nearly choked on her coffee. Lukas let out a sound that might have been a laugh if you knew what to listen for. Cody felt something loosen in his chest, some knot he hadn't realized he'd been carrying.

This was what pack meant, he thought. The hard stuff and the easy stuff, all tangled together. Terrible diner coffee and arguments about elevator incidents and Benji trying to eat more food than any hedgehog should be able to fit in his body.

He took a bite of his eggs. They were overcooked and underseasoned and somehow exactly what he needed.

They finished eating without anyone bringing up the plan again. Thorne paid the bill before anyone could argue, dropping cash on the table with a look that shut down any protests. Benji made one last desperate grab for the coffee pot before the waitress took it away, failed, and mourned loudly all the way to the parking lot.

The drive to the stadium took another hour. Gem handled the wheel with the same focused efficiency she brought to everything else, navigating the increasingly heavy traffic with minimal commentary. Benji had called shotgun before anyone else could claim it, which meant the back seat was a wall of fur and muscle that had no business being crammed into a space meant for two. Thorne sat with his knees practically at his chin, taking up half the seat by himself. Lukas was pressed against Cody so tight there wasn't a hair's width between them, and every time Gem took a turn, all three of them shifted like cargo that hadn't been tied down right.

"This is inhumane," Thorne rumbled from somewhere behind his own knees.

Benji twisted around from the front seat, where he had enough room to practically lie down. "Should've called shotgun faster, big guy."

"I will remember this."

"Worth it."

Benji turned back to his laptop, fingers flying across the screen, occasionally muttering to himself. Thorne closed his eyes, not sleeping but doing that thing bears did where they went somewhere quiet inside their own heads. Probably imagining revenge. Lukas caught Cody's eye and shrugged as much as the cramped space allowed, which wasn't much.

The stadium appeared on the horizon like a promise and a threat all at once. Cody had seen it before, that day Lukas took him on the tour, but it looked different now. Bigger. The parking lots were already filling up, cars streaming in from every direction, and even from this distance he could hear the bass thump of music playing somewhere near the tailgate area.

"Forty thousand people by kickoff," Gem said. "Give or take."

Forty thousand witnesses. The thought sat heavy in Cody's stomach alongside the eggs.

They parked in a lot reserved for players' families, thanks to some arrangement Lukas had made. Getting out of the car felt like stepping into another world. The noise hit first, a wall of sound made up of a hundred different conversations, car horns, someone's sound system blasting fight songs. Then the smell: grilled meat, beer from a dozen open coolers, the particular funk of too many people packed together in late autumn air. Early arrivals, tailgaters setting up grills and canopy tents, but already enough of a crowd to disappear into.

Lukas checked his phone. "Gotta go. Warmups in twenty."

This was it, then. The moment where they split up and the plan started for real. Cody felt something tighten in his chest.

Thorne clapped Benji on the shoulder hard enough to make the hedgehog stumble. "Don't do anything stupid."

"That's literally the whole plan," Benji said.

"Stupider than the plan, then."

Lukas stepped closer to Cody, and for a second it looked like he wanted to say something. His paw came up, hesitated, then landed briefly on Cody's arm. "See you after."

"Yeah." Cody's throat felt thick. "Go be scary."

Lukas's mouth twitched. Then he and Thorne headed toward the players' entrance, two massive shapes cutting through the crowd until the sea of fans swallowed them up.

Gem watched them go, then turned to Cody and Benji. "Alright. Let's find somewhere to wait."

They made their way through the tailgate area, weaving between grills and folding chairs and groups of fans already deep into pre-game rituals. Cody stuck close to Gem and Benji, scanning automatically, reading the crowd the way he always did. Looking for the shape of danger before it had a chance to form.

That's when he saw him.

Dean Graves stood about fifty yards away, near the main concourse entrance. He was surrounded by a small cluster of people in expensive coats, the kind of people who had buildings named after them. Donors. Board members. The dean was in full performance mode, gesturing expansively, his smile wide and warm and absolutely fake if you knew what to look for.

Cody's feet stopped moving.

He felt the pull immediately, that familiar heat flickering to life somewhere behind his ribs. Fifty yards. He could close that distance in thirty seconds. Walk right up to him, get in his face, let him see exactly who was standing there in front of all his important friends. Let him know that the subject, the data point, the opportunity had a name and a voice and wasn't afraid anymore.

"Cody." Gem's voice, sharp. She'd stopped a few feet ahead, noticed he wasn't following. "What is it?"

He didn't answer. The heat was spreading now, down his arms, into his hands. He remembered the weight of his fists, the way it felt to stop asking and start swinging. Three seconds of satisfaction before the red cleared and he saw what he'd done.

*That's what you did. It ain't who you are.*

Lukas's words from last night cut through the noise. And then Gem's, right after: *Tomorrow you use words. That's who you're choosing to be.*

Cody stood there, people flowing around him like water around a rock, and felt the heat slowly bank down to something manageable. Graves was still talking, still performing, completely unaware that the person who was about to destroy his entire world was standing fifty yards away with the means and the motive and the opportunity.

But not yet. Not like this.

This wasn't the moment. The confrontation on the concourse, the one he'd talked about last night, the one Lukas had tried to argue him out of — that would have been about anger and proving something to himself. The old Cody who didn't know any other way to fight back except with his fists.

The speech was different. The speech was about justice and evidence and forty thousand witnesses who couldn't look away.

*Tomorrow you use words.*

Today. Today he used words.

Cody turned his back on Dean Graves. The man never even looked his way, too busy charming people who would hate him by halftime.

"Come on," Cody said. His voice came out steadier than he expected. "Let's find our seats."

Gem was watching him with something sharp in her eyes. She glanced past him, toward where Graves was still holding court, then back. Her tail flicked once.

"You saw him," she said. Not a question.

"Yeah."

"And you're walking away."

"Yeah."

She studied him for another second, like she was running calculations. Then something shifted in her expression, just a fraction. "Good. That's the smart play." She turned toward the stadium entrance. "Let's go."

They pushed through the crowd toward the student section, Benji falling into step beside them. The stadium was still filling up, maybe ten thousand people scattered across the stands so far, but more streaming in every minute. By kickoff there'd be forty thousand. Forty thousand witnesses.

Cody didn't look back.
