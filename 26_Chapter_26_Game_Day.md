# Chapter 26: Game Day

The stadium filled around them seat by seat, section by section. What had been scattered clusters of fans when they sat down was now a solid mass of green and black, bodies pressing into seats, voices layering over each other until the noise became its own kind of weather. Vendors worked the aisles hawking hot dogs and sodas, their calls cutting through the din. Music thumped from speakers somewhere overhead, bass heavy enough that Cody could feel it in his chest.

He'd been to games before, back when he played. But never anything like this. Forty thousand seats, and it looked like every single one was going to be filled.

Beside him, Benji had his laptop balanced on his knees, fingers moving across the keyboard in short bursts between glances at the field. His leg bounced constantly, that restless energy looking for somewhere to go. On Cody's other side, Gem sat perfectly still, watching the empty field with the kind of focus she usually reserved for test results. Her tail curled around her ankles, the only sign she wasn't carved from stone.

"How long?" Cody asked.

Gem checked her phone. "Twelve minutes to kickoff."

Twelve minutes until kickoff, a couple hours until halftime, and then everything changed. One way or another.

The scoreboard flickered to life, cycling through stats and graphics. The crowd noise swelled and dipped in waves, conversations and laughter and the occasional burst of a fight song from somewhere in the student section. Cody watched a family squeeze into seats three rows down, a kit in a tiny Badgers jersey clutching a foam finger almost as big as she was.

Normal people having a normal day, no idea what was coming.

A roar started somewhere near the tunnel and spread through the stadium like a lit fuse. The speakers crackled, and a voice boomed across the field: "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome YOUR TIMBERWOOD BADGERS!"

The tunnel doors burst open. Green and black flooded out, a wall of helmets and pads and muscle, the team spreading across the field in formation. The crowd was on its feet instantly, Cody included, the noise so loud it stopped being sound and became pressure.

He scanned the numbers. 54, 71, 89... there.

Number 87. Lukas jogged out near the middle of the pack, helmet already on, jaw visible beneath the facemask. Even from this distance, Cody could see the set of his shoulders, the coiled tension in the way he moved. Thorne ran beside him, massive even among the linemen, his number 74 stretched across a back wide enough to block out the sun.

They couldn't wave, couldn't acknowledge each other at all. Lukas's eyes swept the stands once, quick, not searching for anyone specific, just taking it in. Then he was past, heading for the sideline with the rest of the defense, and Cody was just another face in forty thousand.

But he'd seen him. That was enough for now.

The anthem played, followed by the coin toss and captains meeting at midfield. Then the kicker was setting up, the crowd holding its breath, and the ball was in the air.

Kickoff.

The first quarter was a knife fight. Ridgewood scored first, a quick drive that made the crowd go quiet, then Timberwood answered with a grinding twelve-play march that ended in a field goal. The lead changed hands twice before the quarter ended, and Cody found himself leaning forward in his seat, his old instincts waking up like a muscle he'd forgotten he had.

He could read the formations, see the mismatches before they developed. When the Ridgewood quarterback dropped back on third and long, Cody knew what was coming before the ball left his hand. Screen play. The lineman in front was letting defenders through on purpose, not blocking them, which meant someone was about to catch a short pass behind all that chaos. The running back was drifting toward the sideline too casually, trying to look like he wasn't the target. Classic misdirection.

Lukas saw it too. He didn't chase the quarterback like the play wanted him to. Just read the setup, ignored the fake, and broke toward the running back before the pass even arrived. The tackle was clean and hard, two yards behind the line of scrimmage, and the crowd erupted.

But something was off. Cody watched Lukas get up, watched the way he shoved away a teammate who tried to slap his helmet. He was playing angry, hitting harder than he needed to, staying in piles longer than necessary. The coiled tension from the tunnel entrance hadn't loosened. If anything, it had gotten tighter.

"He okay?" Benji asked, not looking up from his laptop.

"I don't know."

The second quarter was more of the same, the score seesawing back and forth. Timberwood up by three, then tied, then down by four, then a touchdown made it 17-14 Badgers with two minutes left in the half. Benji's fingers never stopped moving, pulling up windows and closing them, running through whatever sequence he'd memorized. At one point he muttered "PA's clean" to no one in particular. A few minutes later: "Jumbotron feed's ready."

Gem checked her phone every thirty seconds. Cody stopped asking how long.

The clock wound down. Ridgewood tried a last-minute drive that stalled at midfield, and the halftime whistle split the air.

Gem was already standing. "Now."

---

The halftime whistle meant one thing: get off the field.

Lukas pulled his helmet off as he jogged toward the tunnel, sweat cooling on his fur in the November air. Around him, the rest of the defense was doing the same, a stream of green and black jerseys flowing toward the locker room while the marching band took the field behind them. Thorne fell into step beside him, breathing hard but steady, his massive frame blocking out the stadium lights.

"You good?" Thorne asked, low enough that only Lukas could hear.

Lukas huffed, pulling at his chin strap. "Fine."

"You're hitting like you're trying to kill someone."

"Maybe I am."

Thorne didn't push it. That was the thing about Thorne, he knew when to talk and when to just be there. They'd figure it out later, after. After whatever was about to happen in those stands, after whatever Cody was about to do. Lukas had seen Gem stand up right before the whistle, had caught that flash of movement in his peripheral vision even from fifty yards away. It was starting.

And he was stuck down here.

The tunnel swallowed them, concrete and fluorescent lights replacing sky and grass. The noise of the crowd faded to a dull roar, then disappeared entirely as they pushed through the double doors into the locker room. Coach Hendricks was already at the whiteboard, marker in hand, diagramming adjustments for the second half. Guys were peeling off pads, grabbing water, finding their lockers.

Lukas dropped onto the bench in front of his and started working on his shoulder pads. His muscles ached in that good way, the kind that meant he'd been playing hard. The score was close, 17-14, and Ridgewood wasn't gonna roll over easy. He needed to focus on the game. Needed to trust that Cody and Gem and Benji knew what they were doing up there.

Easier said than done.

"Raines."

The voice came from behind him, and Lukas didn't need to turn around to know who it was. He'd known that voice since they were six years old, running around Rumi's backyard pretending to be pro players.

"Not now, Rumi."

"Yeah, now."

Lukas turned. Rumi Castillo stood three feet away, still in full pads, helmet dangling from one hand. His eyes had that wild look, the one Lukas remembered from middle school when someone said the wrong thing and Rumi couldn't let it go. Back then it had been about respect and proving himself. Now it was about something uglier.

"I know what you're doing," Rumi said. "Hiding your little pet up in the stands. You think the Dean doesn't know? You think this is just gonna blow over?"

"Walk away."

"He's not done with this, Lukas. None of you are. And when it all comes down, I'm not gonna be the one standing in the wreckage."

Lukas stood up slowly, using every inch of his height. "You already are."

Something flickered across Rumi's face, doubt or fear or maybe both. But it got swallowed up by anger before it could take root, and his free hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of Lukas's jersey.

"You used to be somebody," Rumi hissed. "You used to matter. Now look at you. Throwing everything away for some freak who fell out of the sky."

"Let go."

"Or what? You gonna hit me? Get yourself thrown out of the game?"

The locker room had gone quiet. Lukas could feel eyes on them, the whole team watching to see what happened next. Rumi's grip tightened, knuckles pressing into Lukas's chest.

Then a shadow fell over both of them.

"He said let go."

Thorne's voice was calm, almost conversational. He'd appeared beside them without making a sound, which shouldn't have been possible for someone his size. His arms hung loose at his sides, but there was nothing relaxed about the look in his eyes.

Rumi's head snapped toward him. "This ain't your business, bear."

"It is now."

For a long moment, nobody moved. The tension in the room was thick enough to choke on, everyone holding their breath, waiting. Rumi's jaw worked, teeth grinding, and Lukas could see him calculating. Too many witnesses. Too many people who'd tell the coach exactly what happened if this went sideways.

But Rumi had never been good at math.

He let go of Lukas's jersey and swung at Thorne instead.

The punch caught Thorne square on the jaw, hard enough that his head snapped to the side. The crack echoed through the locker room, and then everything exploded at once.

"HEY! HEY!"

Two linemen grabbed Rumi from behind, hauling him back. Someone else was shouting for coach. A water bottle went flying, knocked off a bench in the chaos. Lukas felt hands on his shoulders too, teammates pulling him away even though he hadn't moved, everyone trying to separate bodies that weren't even fighting anymore.

Because Thorne hadn't swung back.

He just stood there in the middle of the chaos, perfectly still while bodies moved around him. A trickle of blood ran from the corner of his mouth, bright red against dark fur. His right hand had curled into a fist, knuckles popping, but he didn't use it. Just looked at Rumi with something that might have been pity. Then he uncurled his fist, wiped the blood from his lip with the back of his hand, and said nothing at all.

"ENOUGH!"

Coach Hendricks pushed through the knot of players, face red, veins standing out on his neck. The linemen holding Rumi let go but stayed close. Hendricks looked at Thorne's bloody lip, at Rumi's still-clenched fist, at the circle of players who'd witnessed the whole thing.

"I saw everything," Hendricks said, voice like gravel. "Castillo, you're done. Benched for the half, maybe for the season. Get out of my sight."

Rumi opened his mouth like he was going to argue, then closed it. The fight drained out of him all at once, shoulders slumping, fist finally dropping to his side. He looked at Lukas one more time, and there was something in his eyes that hadn't been there before. Something quieter than anger, rawer than defiance.

Understanding. The first crack of it, anyway. The realization that he'd just thrown away everything he'd been chasing, and for what? The Dean had offered him a path, and he'd taken it. Made his choice. And now he was standing in a locker room full of teammates who'd never look at him the same way again, and no scholarship or roster spot was going to fix that.

Rumi turned and walked to the far end of the bench, sat down, and stared at the wall.

Lukas and Thorne exchanged a look.

"You okay?" Lukas asked quietly.

Thorne shrugged, reached up to touch his jaw, winced slightly. "He hits like a kitten." Then he picked up his helmet and walked back to his locker like nothing had happened.

Coach Hendricks didn't go back to the whiteboard. He stood in the middle of the room, arms crossed, letting the silence stretch until it hurt.

"Fifteen years I've been coaching," he said, voice low and hard. "Fifteen years. And I have never, NEVER, seen someone throw away their future like that in the middle of a playoff game." He pointed at Rumi without looking at him. "You want to fight? You want to act like a damn fool? Do it on your own time. Not in my locker room. Not when we're three points up and thirty minutes away from the championship bracket."

Nobody moved, nobody breathed.

Hendricks swept his gaze across the room, making sure every single player felt it. "Anyone else got something to get off their chest? Now's the time." Silence. "Good. Then sit down, shut up, and remember why you're here."

He turned back to the whiteboard, snatched up the marker, and started diagramming with short, angry strokes. The tension in the room didn't bleed away so much as get shoved down, buried under the familiar rhythm of halftime prep. But it was still there, humming underneath everything.

Lukas grabbed his water bottle, took a long drink, and made himself focus on the whiteboard. Hendricks was adjusting the coverage on third down, shifting responsibilities, talking about Ridgewood's tendency to go to their tight end in the red zone. Lukas nodded in the right places, committed the changes to memory. This was his job. This was what he could control.

But when Hendricks paused to erase a line and redraw it, Lukas's eyes drifted to the locker room door. Just for a second. Somewhere out there, past the concrete and the tunnel and the forty thousand people in those stands, Cody was about to do something that couldn't be undone.

He hoped it was enough.

Then Hendricks was talking again, and Lukas shoved the thought down with everything else.

---

Gem was already moving before the echo of the halftime whistle faded.

"Stay close," she said, not looking back. "Don't run. Don't make eye contact. Just walk like you belong."

Cody followed her down the stadium steps, weaving through fans heading for concessions and bathrooms. Benji brought up the rear, laptop bag bouncing against his hip, quills flattened with focus. The noise of the halftime show thumped from the field behind them, drums and brass and the roar of a crowd that had no idea what was about to happen.

They hit the concourse level and Gem cut left, away from the food vendors and the merchandise stands, toward a stretch of wall that looked like nothing special. Plain concrete, a fire extinguisher, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

"Benji," Gem said.

He was already fishing a keycard from his pocket. "Cloned it off a maintenance guy last week. Should still work." He swiped it. The lock clicked red. "Or not."

"Try again."

Another swipe, red again, then green. The door popped open.

"Third time's the charm," Benji said, grinning. "Definitely charm."

They slipped through into the service corridor. The air changed immediately, stadium noise muffling behind the heavy door. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, pipes running along the ceiling.

"This is where we split," Gem said. She pointed down the corridor. "Benji, AV control is two levels up, third door on the right. You've got maybe six minutes to get the PA and Jumbotron ready."

Benji was already moving. "PA's prepped, video file's loaded, just give me six minutes."

"Six minutes," Gem repeated.

"Got it, got it." He paused, looked back at Cody. "When you're ready, say something into the mic. Anything. I'll know you're live and I'll be listening for the cue."

"What cue?"

Benji grinned, some of his usual chaos creeping back. "You'll know. Just make it dramatic." Then he was gone, footsteps echoing down the corridor until they faded.

Gem turned to Cody. "You ready?"

"No."

"Good answer." She started walking the opposite direction. "This way. Service tunnel comes out at field level, near the visiting team entrance. Should be clear during halftime."

They moved fast through the concrete maze, taking turns Gem seemed to know by instinct. The halftime show thumped above them, muffled bass making the walls vibrate. Twice they passed maintenance workers who barely glanced up from their phones.

Then Gem stopped at a door marked FIELD ACCESS - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

"This is you," she said. She pulled something from her pocket and pressed it into his hand. A wireless microphone, small and black, the kind coaches wore on the sidelines. "Benji rigged it to patch into the PA system. Soon as you turn it on, the whole stadium hears you."

Cody turned it over in his hand. Such a small thing. Such a big moment.

"I'll be watching from the tunnel," Gem said. "Soon as you're done, we move. You say what you need to say, Benji plays the footage, and we get you somewhere safe before security figures out what happened."

Cody nodded. His pulse was up, adrenaline already starting to hum through his veins, but it wasn't fear. It was the feeling he used to get before a big game. The feeling right before the play clock hit zero and everything started moving.

"Hey." Gem's paw landed on his shoulder, squeezed once. "You've got this."

"I know." He meant it. He'd been through worse than a speech. He'd survived worse than a crowd. Last time, strapped to that table, his brain had found the way out even when his body couldn't move. This time, he got to use both.

"Go get him," Gem said.

Cody pushed through the door.

The light hit him first. Stadium lights blazing down, bright enough to wash out the afternoon sky. Then the noise, the sheer wall of it, forty thousand voices and the halftime show's final crescendo mixing into something that felt less like sound and more like weather. The field stretched out in front of him, green and perfect, yard lines crisp white against the turf.

The marching band was finishing up, filing off toward the far end zone. Cheerleaders clustered near the sideline. Camera crews repositioned for the second half. Nobody was looking at him yet.

That was about to change.

Cody walked onto the field.

He made it to the forty-yard line before people started noticing. A few heads turning, then more, then whole sections of the crowd rising to their feet. The murmur started small and spread fast, confusion and shock rippling through the stands. Fingers pointing. Phones coming up. He could almost hear the questions bouncing through forty thousand minds at once: What is that? Is that a... is that a HUMAN?

Most of them had probably never seen one in real life. 

Security would be coming soon. He had maybe a minute, probably less.

He clicked the microphone on.

The PA system crackled, sharp and loud, slicing through the murmur. The crowd noise shifted, forty thousand people realizing at once that this wasn't just some streaker or halftime prank. The human had a microphone. The human was about to speak.

Cody looked out at the sea of faces. Wolves and bears and foxes and deer, thousands of them, staring back at him with expressions ranging from confusion to fear to fascination. He'd never felt so small in his life, and he'd never felt so sure of what he needed to do.

He took a breath, let it out slow, and started talking.

"My name's Cody."

His voice boomed across the stadium, echoing off concrete and steel, and the last of the halftime buzz died like someone had hit a switch. Forty thousand faces locked onto him, waiting, barely breathing.

"Week ago, I fell through a hole in the sky and landed in your woods. I didn't ask for it and I sure as hell didn't want it, but here I am."

He could see security moving now, coming from both sidelines, but they were hesitant and confused. This wasn't in the playbook. Nobody had told them what to do about a human standing at the forty-yard line talking into a microphone.

"First guy I met here was kind to me. Gave me a place to sleep, food to eat, made me feel like I wasn't alone. I started thinking maybe this place wasn't so bad."

His voice found its rhythm. The shaking in his hands steadied. This was just talking. Just telling the truth. He'd done harder things than this.

"Then I met Dean Graves."

The name landed like a stone dropped into still water. He could feel the ripple spreading through the crowd, the sudden sharpening of attention. Security had stopped moving, caught between confusion and curiosity like everyone else.

"He sat me down in his office, smiled at me, offered me candy from a little bowl on his desk. Told me he wanted to help. Told me he understood what I was going through. And I believed him. Because I wanted to."

His voice hardened without him meaning it to. He could feel his pulse in his throat, the anger trying to take over, but he kept it leashed. Controlled. This wasn't about rage. This was about truth.

"And because I believed him, I pushed away the folks who actually cared about me. The ones who'd taken me in, fed me, kept me safe. I called them liars. I walked right into his hands."

He let that sit for a beat. Owning it. Then he kept going.

"And what did I get for trusting him? He threatened the folks who'd taken me in. Told them their scholarships, their academic careers, everything they'd worked for would disappear unless they handed me over."

His grip on the microphone tightened, but he kept his voice steady.

"So I went to talk to him. Face to face. Thought maybe I could reason with him, protect the folks who'd been protecting me. And you know what I got? Sedated and hauled away like cargo."

He let that land before continuing.

"I woke up strapped to a table in a room in the basement of the science building. And that same man who offered me candy stood over me with a clipboard and told me exactly what he was gonna do. Every test. Every sample. Every way he was gonna cut me open to get his name in a journal."

Silence now. The kind of silence that happens when forty thousand people stop breathing at the same time.

"He told me I wasn't the first. That other people fell through before me. That one of them died on that table, and he buried it. No authorities. No investigation. Just gone."

Cody paused. Let that sink in. Then he felt something shift in his chest, the nervous energy transforming into something else. Something that felt almost like confidence. Former captain energy, Thorne might have called it. The feeling of standing on a field with everyone watching and knowing exactly what to do next.

"Now, I could stand here and tell you what kind of man Victor Graves really is." He turned toward the Jumbotron, arm sweeping up in a gesture that felt natural now, like calling a play. "But I think it's better if you hear it from him."

He pointed at the massive screen.

"Roll it!"

The Jumbotron flickered, went dark for half a second, and then Room B-7 filled the screen. Forty feet tall, bright as daylight, impossible to miss. The concrete walls, the equipment racks, the table with straps hanging loose. And standing in the middle of it all, a snow leopard in a lab coat, silver-white fur immaculate, pale blue eyes fixed on something off-camera.

On Cody. Strapped down and helpless.

The audio crackled through the stadium speakers, clear as a bell.

"Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name."

Graves's voice, soft and clinical and utterly damning, echoed across forty thousand stunned faces. The footage kept rolling. The sampling kit. The clipboard. The casual discussion of tissue extraction and resonance mapping while Cody lay there unable to move.

Phones came out everywhere. Thousands of tiny screens lighting up, recording, capturing. The evidence playing on an endless loop while the crowd watched in horror.

Cody lowered his arm. The Jumbotron kept playing, but he wasn't watching anymore. He was looking toward the press box, toward the donor suites, searching for a flash of silver-white fur.

He didn't have to search long.

Graves was already coming down. Moving fast through the crowd near the stairs, security trailing behind him, that careful composure cracking with every step. Even from this distance, Cody could see it. The mask slipping.

Good. Let him come. Let everyone see what happened next.

Cody stood at the forty-yard line and waited.

---

Graves reached him in under a minute.

The Dean's fur was disheveled, his suit jacket askew, his carefully maintained composure hanging by threads. Security flanked him on both sides, but they weren't restraining him. Not yet. These were his people. His loyalists. They'd escorted him down, not held him back.

The Jumbotron still played the footage on loop behind them. Forty feet of evidence, impossible to ignore.

"You don't understand what you've done."

The voice was soft, clinical, trying to reclaim control. But Cody could hear the cracks underneath. He could also hear Graves's words echoing back from the stadium speakers, the mic in his hand still live, still broadcasting. Graves either didn't notice or didn't care.

"I understand exactly what I've done."

Graves stepped closer, and Cody held his ground. Around them, the stadium had gone quiet again, everyone watching, everyone recording, everyone waiting to see what happened next.

"That footage is out of context," Graves said, voice still controlled but tight around the edges. "You're confused. Traumatized. I was trying to help you, to understand what you ARE. Do you have any idea what your existence means to science? To this entire world?"

"I know what it meant to you."

Something flickered in those pale blue eyes. The mask slipping, just a little.

"I gave you shelter. I gave you answers. I was going to make you SIGNIFICANT." Graves's claws started to curl, the professional veneer cracking. "And this is how you repay me? By destroying everything I've built? Do you know what you've cost this university? What you've cost ME?"

Cody felt his hands wanting to curl into fists. The old familiar pressure, the one that used to mean fists flying and consequences later. His body wanted to move, to hit, to make Graves feel even a fraction of what he'd felt strapped to that table.

But he stayed planted. Kept his voice steady.

"You strapped me to a table."

"FOR SCIENCE!" The softness was gone now, Graves's voice rising, and the words boomed back from the stadium speakers a half-second later, forty thousand witnesses hearing the Dean of Academic Affairs screaming justifications for human experimentation. A ripple of shock went through the crowd. Someone in the stands yelled something Cody couldn't make out. "For knowledge that would have changed everything! Fifteen years I've waited, FIFTEEN YEARS, and you just... you just..."

"You're scared, aren't you?"

Graves stopped. The words hit him like a slap, cutting through the spiral.

"What?"

"Not of me," Cody said quietly. Every word landing like a hammer. "Of being nobody again. Fifteen years of waiting, and this was supposed to be your legacy. Your name in the journals. Your face at the conferences. But you're not gonna get it. Because I'm not your subject. I'm not your data. I'm just a guy who fell through a hole in the sky."

He let that sit for a beat. Then:

"And I've got folks who actually give a damn about me. What do you have?"

The crack happened all at once.

Graves's face twisted, something ugly and raw surfacing from underneath all those years of careful control. His claws extended fully, his lips pulled back from his teeth, and he lunged. Not calculated, not measured, just pure desperate rage, reaching for Cody like he could somehow take it all back if he could just get his paws around the human's throat.

Cody didn't flinch, didn't move. Just watched him come.

Security grabbed Graves before he got there. Two of them, hauling him back by the arms, but everyone had already seen. Every phone in the stadium had already captured the Dean of Academic Affairs lunging at a student on the forty-yard line. The crowd erupted, gasps and shouts and a growing roar of disbelief. Somewhere in the stands, someone was booing. Then more joined in.

"You're NOTHING!" Graves was shouting now, all pretense abandoned, thrashing against the guards holding him, his words still echoing through every speaker in the stadium. "You hear me? NOTHING! I made you MATTER! Without me you're just another accident! Another piece of DEBRIS!"

The boos were spreading now, rolling down from the upper decks like thunder. Forty thousand people watching a man they'd trusted, a man who'd shaken their hands at fundraisers and smiled at them in hallways, completely fall apart.

Cody didn't respond. Just stood there, hands at his sides, and watched them drag him away.

The mask wasn't slipping anymore. It was gone. Shattered into pieces on the field in front of everyone who'd ever believed in him.

Gem appeared at his elbow, crossing from the tunnel entrance. Benji was jogging across the field from somewhere near the press box, laptop bag bouncing. The crowd noise was shifting now, the boos fading into something else. Someone started clapping. Then more. It spread through the stands in uneven waves, not the thunderous roar of a touchdown but something quieter, more uncertain. Applause for a moment no one had expected to witness.

Cody raised the mic one more time.

"Thanks for listening."

He clicked it off. The applause swelled briefly, then began to settle as forty thousand people tried to process what they'd just witnessed.

"You okay?" Gem asked finally.

Cody thought about it. His hands had stopped shaking. The tension that had been coiled in his shoulders all day had finally let go.

"Yeah," he said. "I think I am."

---

They didn't get to stand there long.

A badger in a university polo pushed through the crowd of staffers and media that had started gathering near the tunnel entrance, a security escort flanking him on both sides. His name tag read CAMPUS OPERATIONS but his expression said something closer to damage control.

"You." He pointed at Cody. "Come with me."

Gem stepped forward, putting herself between them. "He's not going anywhere without us."

The badger looked like he wanted to argue, but something in Gem's eyes made him reconsider. He glanced at the security guards, then back at the three of them, then at the crowd of people still recording on their phones.

"Fine. All of you. Now."

They followed him through the tunnel and into a conference room tucked behind the athletic offices. The walls were lined with team photos and championship banners, and a long table dominated the center of the space. Two more officials were already waiting inside, a deer in a blazer who introduced herself as Associate Dean Morrison and a wolf in campus security uniform who didn't introduce himself at all.

The badger shut the door. "Who are you? What the hell was that out there?"

Cody opened his mouth to answer, but Morrison held up a hoof.

"Wait." She was looking at her phone, scrolling through something. The footage, probably. It was already everywhere. "Before you say anything, I need to understand what we're dealing with here." She looked up at Cody, and her expression had shifted from confusion to something more careful. "What did Dean Graves do to you?"

Cody told them. The short version, at least. Office 412. The candy bowl. The email threatening his friends. Waking up strapped to a table in a basement room. The things Graves had said while standing over him with a clipboard.

"The email," Gem said, already pulling out her phone. "I still have it. Sent to my campus account." She handed it to Morrison, who read it with the security wolf looking over her shoulder.

*Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

Morrison's expression hardened as she read. "He put this in writing?"

"Signed it too," Gem said. "Warm regards, Dean Victor Graves."

Nobody interrupted after that. By the end, Morrison's face had gone pale under her fur.

"The footage," she said slowly. "That's all real? That room, that equipment, that's on this campus?"

"Room B-7," Cody said. "Sublevel of the science building."

Morrison and the badger exchanged a look that said entire careers are about to end over this. The security wolf was already on his radio, speaking in low tones.

She stood, straightening her blazer. "We'll need a full statement, but that can wait until tomorrow. Monday morning, my office, nine AM. Bring your friends." She paused at the door. "Tonight, just... watch the game. You've earned that much."

Then she was gone, the badger and the wolf following, and Cody was left standing in the conference room with Gem and Benji.

"Well," Benji said after a moment. "That went better than expected."

Gem shot him a look.

"What? I was ready for handcuffs. This is a win."

They made their way back to the field. The second half was about to start, players jogging back onto the turf, the crowd noise building again as people tried to process what they'd just witnessed while also remembering there was still a football game happening. The Jumbotron had finally stopped playing the footage, replaced by the normal game graphics and sponsor logos.

Cody found a spot on the sideline, just behind the team bench, close enough to see the field but out of the way of the coaches and trainers moving back and forth. Gem stood on one side of him, Benji on the other. They didn't say anything. They didn't need to.

The defense took the field first. Cody scanned the jerseys until he found number 87, Lukas lining up at his position, helmet on, shoulders set. He looked the same as he had in the first half, focused and intense, but something was different. Cody could see it in the way he held himself, a tension that hadn't been there before.

Then Lukas turned.

He wasn't scanning the stands this time, just turning like he knew exactly where to look, and his eyes found Cody on the sideline, ten feet away.

The moment lasted maybe two seconds. Lukas's face was hidden behind his helmet, but Cody could feel the weight of that look. I see you. You made it. Now let me finish this.

Cody nodded, small, just enough to say he understood.

Lukas turned back to the field. And something in his posture changed, a looseness that hadn't been there before, like a weight had lifted off his shoulders.

The whistle blew. The second half started.

The third quarter was a grind. Both teams traded punts, neither offense finding any rhythm, the defenses locked in a war of attrition. Timberwood's lead held at three points, then Ridgewood tied it with a field goal, then Timberwood went back up by four on a short touchdown run. The crowd was on its feet for every play, the earlier chaos fading into the background as the game took over.

Cody watched it all from the sideline, his old instincts firing in ways they hadn't in almost three years. He could read the formations, see the mismatches, predict the plays before they developed. When Ridgewood's quarterback changed the play at the last second, Cody knew it was a short pass before the ball was even snapped. When Timberwood's offense bunched up tight on a crucial third down, he knew they were going to pound it straight ahead.

Football had been his whole life once. Before the incident, before everything fell apart. Standing here, close enough to hear the coaches calling plays and the players shouting adjustments, it felt like reconnecting with a part of himself he'd thought was gone.

The fourth quarter started with Ridgewood driving. They scored on a long march that ate up six minutes of clock, taking the lead 28-24. Timberwood answered with a field goal, cutting it to one. Then Ridgewood got the ball back with four minutes left.

Three minutes left, then two. Ridgewood running the ball on every play, trying to bleed the clock dry.

Cody watched the offensive line, the way one of the blockers was leaning before each snap, telegraphing the direction of the run. They're setting something up, his brain said. Trying to sucker the defense into overcommitting.

On the field, Lukas was reading the same thing. Cody could see it in the way he shifted his weight, refusing to take the bait.

The ball snapped.

The running back took the handoff and followed his blockers toward what looked like an open lane on the right side. But Lukas didn't bite. He cut the other direction, found the real gap, and met the runner before he'd taken two steps. The collision was loud enough to hear from the sideline.

The ball popped loose.

For one frozen moment, everyone just stared at it bouncing on the turf. Then Lukas was there, scooping it up in stride without breaking momentum, and suddenly he wasn't a defender anymore. He was a runner with nothing but open field ahead of him.

Timberwood ball. Forty-two yards from the end zone. And Lukas was already moving.

A defender grabbed at his jersey and missed. Another came in for the tackle and Lukas spun through it, still on his feet, still moving. The forty-yard line, then the thirty, the crowd noise hitting a pitch Cody felt in his teeth, in his bones, in every part of him. The twenty, a defender diving and getting nothing but air. The ten, Cody screaming something he didn't know what, his voice lost in the roar of forty thousand people. The five.

Lukas crossed the goal line and the scoreboard flipped: BADGERS 33, RIDGEWOOD 28. The clock hit zero half a second later.

The stadium exploded.

---

Cody didn't remember pushing through the crowd that flooded onto the field. He didn't remember shoving past reporters and cameras and delirious fans. He just remembered finding Lukas in the middle of the chaos, helmet off, fur matted with sweat, and then they were hugging, Lukas's arms crushing him against that massive chest while people screamed and confetti fell from somewhere and the scoreboard flashed BADGERS WIN over and over.

"You did it," Cody said into Lukas's shoulder. "Holy shit, you actually did it."

Lukas pulled back just enough to look at him. His eyes were wet, and Cody couldn't tell if it was sweat or tears or both. "I saw you on the sideline. When I turned around and you were just there." He shook his head. "I knew. Whatever happened, whatever you did, I knew you were okay."

"I'm okay," Cody said. "We're okay."

Then Thorne was there, lifting both of them off the ground in a bear hug that made Cody's ribs creak. Benji was bouncing around them like a kid on Christmas morning, quills practically vibrating with excitement. And Gem was standing a few feet away, arms crossed, trying to look unimpressed, but the smile tugging at the corner of her mouth gave her away.

The pack. His pack. All of them together on a football field while the world celebrated around them.

Cody let himself feel it, the victory and the relief and the bone-deep exhaustion that came from finally, finally being done with hiding and running and being afraid.

Monday there would be statements and investigations and probably a lot of uncomfortable questions. Monday they'd have to deal with whatever came next. But tonight? Tonight a dean was in custody, a wolf had just run forty-two yards for the win, and Cody was standing on a football field with people who'd risked everything to keep him safe.

Tonight they'd won.

All of it.

# Interlude: The Fall

The shredder made a sound like teeth grinding.

Victor Graves fed another stack of papers into the slot and watched fifteen years of research turn into confetti. Subject files. Protocol notes. Observation logs. All of it, gone in seconds, reduced to strips of nothing that piled up in the bin below.

His office door was open. It was always open. That was the Victor Graves brand, the signature move that had defined his tenure as Dean. My door is always open. Come in anytime. I'm here for you. A generation of students and faculty had walked through that door believing they were meeting a mentor, an ally, a friend. None of them had ever understood that the open door wasn't an invitation. It was a trap. A way to keep everyone visible, everyone accessible, everyone where he could see them coming.

Now the door hung open on an empty hallway, and Victor couldn't bring himself to close it.

His phone buzzed on the desk. He glanced at the screen. Chancellor Morrison. The fourth call in ten minutes. He let it ring through to voicemail, the same way he'd let the previous three go. The same way he'd let the calls from Legal go, from the Provost, from Campus Security. They all wanted to talk. They all wanted explanations. They all wanted to figure out how to handle this, how to contain it, how to make it go away.

None of them understood. There was no containing this. The footage was everywhere. Every phone in that stadium had recorded it, uploaded it, shared it before halftime was even over. His face was on every screen in the state by now, probably the country, his voice playing on loop: Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name.

The shredder jammed. Victor cursed and yanked at the paper, tearing it, fingers trembling as he tried to clear the teeth. His paws weren't steady anymore. Hadn't been since security had driven him back here from the stadium, since they'd walked him into his own building without a word and left him alone in his office like a prisoner in a holding cell.

He got the shredder running again and fed it another stack. Personnel records. Research grants. The documentation for Room B-7 that he should have destroyed years ago but had kept because he'd thought he might need it someday, might need proof of what he'd accomplished when the world finally recognized his work.

The world was recognizing it now.

His phone buzzed again. This time the screen showed a different name: VICTOR. His son. Victor Jr., who he hadn't spoken to in almost two years, who had stopped returning calls somewhere around the third missed birthday, who had finally given up on a father who was always too busy, always too focused, always chasing something more important than family dinners and graduation ceremonies and all the small moments that added up to a life.

Victor let that call go to voicemail too.

On the wall behind his desk, his diplomas hung in their frames, the gold lettering catching the fluorescent light. PhD in Xenobiology. Advanced Research Fellowship. Distinguished Faculty Award. Fifteen years of credentials, fifteen years of proof that he mattered, that he was somebody, that his name meant something in the halls of academia.

Beside the diplomas, a row of photographs he hadn't looked at in years. His wedding day, both of them young and smiling, before the long hours and the missed anniversaries and the slow erosion of everything that wasn't work. Victor Jr. as a cub, sitting on his father's shoulders at some campus event, his small paws gripping the fur on Victor's head. A family portrait from a decade ago, all three of them posed and stiff, the kind of photo you put on a wall and forget to dust.

The frames were dusty now. He could see it from here, the thin film covering the glass, proof of how long it had been since he'd done anything but glance past them on his way to something more important.

The shredder kept grinding. The bin was almost full.

Footsteps in the hallway. Multiple sets, heavy and deliberate, the kind of footsteps that didn't belong to students or faculty.

Victor looked up.

A Bengal tiger filled the doorway, massive and striped, wearing the uniform of University Oversight. Two more officers flanked him, wolves in tactical gear, their expressions professionally blank. Behind them, two campus security guards that Victor recognized, the same ones who had driven him here from the stadium. They wouldn't meet his eyes.

"Victor Graves." The tiger's voice was flat. "Step away from the desk."

Victor's paw hovered over the shredder's feed slot, one last stack of papers clutched in his grip. Evidence. Proof. Everything they would need to bury him.

"I'm the Dean of Academic Affairs," he said. The words came out wrong, too high, too desperate. "I have rights. I have tenure. You can't just walk into my office and..."

"Victor Graves." The tiger stepped into the room, and suddenly the space felt very small. "You are under arrest by the authority of Timberwood Hollow for kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault, illegal experimentation on a sentient being, conspiracy, abuse of institutional authority, and accessory to the death of Subject TH-2010-003."

The papers slipped from Victor's fingers.

"Turn around. Hands behind your back."

Victor turned. The metal was cold against his wrists, the click of the cuffs loud in the quiet office. One of the wolves gathered the fallen papers, the unshredded evidence, everything Victor hadn't managed to destroy in time.

The tiger glanced at the shredder, still running, the bin overflowing with confetti. "Add destruction of evidence to the list."

"Let's go."

They walked him out of his office, past his nameplate on the door. VICTOR GRAVES, Ph.D. Dean of Academic Affairs. The brass plate he'd polished himself when he'd first been appointed, the title he'd spent his whole career chasing. Down the hallway of Whitmore Hall, the same hallway he'd walked a thousand times, ten thousand times, always with purpose, always with authority, always knowing that everyone who saw him knew exactly who he was and what he meant to this institution.

Students were gathered at the end of the hall. Word traveled fast on a college campus, even faster when the news was this big. They parted as the officers approached, pressing against the walls to make room, and Victor could feel their eyes on him. Phones came up. Screens glowing, cameras pointed, everyone recording.

"Holy shit," someone whispered. "Is that..."

"That's the Dean. That's Dean Graves."

"He's in handcuffs."

Victor kept his eyes forward, but he could hear the whispers spreading, could feel the weight of all those stares, all those lenses, all those witnesses who would share this moment with everyone they knew.

Faculty had gathered too. Colleagues he'd worked with for years, professors who had sat in his meetings and laughed at his jokes and competed for his approval. Dr. Whitmore from Chemistry. Professor Santos from Biology. The department heads he'd mentored, promoted, shaped into allies. They watched him pass in silence, and not one of them looked away.

The lobby of Whitmore Hall was worse.

A television mounted on the wall was tuned to a local news channel, and Victor's face filled the screen. Not a photo, not a headshot, but the footage. The footage from Room B-7, the footage he'd never imagined anyone would see, playing on a loop while a news anchor's voice provided commentary he couldn't quite hear over the blood rushing in his ears.

"Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name."

His own words, echoing back at him as he was led through the building in handcuffs.

The front doors of Whitmore Hall loomed ahead. Glass and steel, the same doors he'd walked through on his first day as Dean, the same doors he'd walked through every morning for fifteen years, always in control, always knowing exactly where he stood and what he was building.

The tiger pushed them open.

Outside, the November air hit Victor's face, cold and sharp. More cameras waited on the steps, news crews who had arrived while he was being processed, reporters shouting questions he couldn't parse through the ringing in his head.

The man who had wanted his name in every journal was about to get his wish.

Just not the way he'd planned.

The doors of Whitmore Hall swung shut behind him, and Victor Graves, former Dean of Academic Affairs, was walked down the steps toward a waiting patrol car while the whole world watched.
