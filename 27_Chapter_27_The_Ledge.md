# Chapter 27: The Ledge

The celebration lasted for over an hour.

Cody lost track of how many people hugged him, slapped his back, shouted things he couldn't hear over the noise. Players he'd never met were grabbing his shoulders and yelling "That was INSANE!" Reporters tried to get close but security kept pushing them back, and somewhere in the chaos Coach Hendricks found him and just stared for a long moment before shaking his hand and walking away without a word.

The pack stayed close. Thorne appointed himself unofficial bodyguard, his massive frame clearing a path through the crowd whenever things got too intense. Benji was everywhere at once, bouncing between conversations, showing people something on his laptop, practically glowing with the kind of energy that came from pulling off the impossible. Gem kept to the edges, watching, but every time Cody caught her eye she gave him a small nod that said more than words would have.

And Lukas. Lukas stayed at his side as long as he could, close enough that their shoulders kept brushing, not saying much but always there. Every few minutes someone would pull him away for a photo or a handshake or a shouted congratulation on the game-winning play, and every time he'd drift back to where Cody was standing like it was the only place he wanted to be.

Eventually Coach Hendricks shouted something about showers and film review, and the team started flowing toward the tunnel. Lukas hesitated, looking at Cody.

"Go," Cody said. "I'm not going anywhere."

Thorne caught Lukas's eye and tilted his head toward the tunnel.

Lukas nodded once, then jogged after his teammates, Thorne falling into step beside him, their numbers vanishing into the crowd of green and black.

The pack waited on the field while the team cleaned up. Benji sat cross-legged on the turf, laptop balanced on his knees, muttering about upload speeds and server traffic. Gem stood with her arms crossed, watching the stands empty, but she looked more relaxed than Cody had ever seen her.

"Hell of a day," she said.

"Yeah." Cody sat down on the bench nearby. "Hell of a day."

Twenty minutes later, Lukas and Thorne emerged from the tunnel, both in civilian clothes, fur still damp from the shower. Lukas wore jeans and a flannel, sleeves rolled to the elbows, gym bag slung over his shoulder. Thorne had on sweats and a Timberwood t-shirt stretched tight across his massive chest. They looked different out of their gear. Smaller, somehow. More like the guys Cody had gotten to know than the wolves and bears who'd just won a playoff game.

The crowd had thinned to almost nothing by then. Parents collecting their kids, fans heading for the parking lots, the maintenance crews starting their slow sweep through the stands. The Jumbotron went dark. The scoreboard stayed lit a while longer, BADGERS 33, RIDGEWOOD 28 glowing against the night sky, before someone finally switched it off.

The stadium lights started clicking off section by section, plunging the stands into darkness. A few maintenance crews moved through the aisles picking up trash, their flashlights bobbing like fireflies in the distance.

Cody stood near the tunnel entrance with the pack, all of them tired and wired and not quite ready to leave. Thorne had his arm around Benji's shoulders, the porcupine's energy finally starting to fade into something closer to exhaustion. Gem stood apart, arms crossed, but she hadn't stopped smiling since they'd walked off the field.

"We should head back," she said finally. "It's late. And some of us have statements to give on Monday."

"Buzzkill," Benji muttered, but he was already yawning.

Thorne stretched, his massive frame blocking out what was left of the light. "Food," he said, already heading toward the parking lot.

"Always," Benji said.

Gem glanced at Lukas, then at Cody. Something flickered in her expression, there and gone. "You two coming?"

Lukas shook his head. "We'll catch up. I want to show Cody something first."

Gem's eyes narrowed for just a second, then softened. She nodded once, turned, and started walking. Thorne and Benji followed, their voices fading into the dark.

Then it was just the two of them, standing on the empty field where everything had happened.

Lukas turned to face him. The stadium lights were almost all off now, just a few security floods casting long shadows across the turf. In the dim light, his amber eyes caught what was left of the glow.

"There's a place I go sometimes," he said. "When I need to think. When everything gets too loud." He paused. "I'd like to show you. If you want."

If you want.

Not follow me or come on or any of the other commands Cody had gotten used to over the past week. Not Lukas grabbing his arm and pulling him somewhere safe. Just an invitation, offered with an open hand.

Cody had spent his whole life being led. By coaches, by his father, by circumstances he couldn't control. Following because he didn't know what else to do, because the path was already laid out, because fighting it was harder than going along.

This was different. This was a choice.

"Yeah," he said. "I'd like that."

They passed through a gate Lukas unlocked with a key from his pocket, down a concrete corridor beneath the stands, and through an unmarked door that opened onto a narrow stairwell. The metal rungs of a maintenance ladder were cold under Cody's hands as he climbed, the November air biting at his fingers, but he didn't stop until he pulled himself onto a flat concrete roof above the press box.

The view hit him like a fist to the chest.

The stadium stretched out below them, dark and silent, the stands empty, the field a black rectangle under the stars. And above, the sky was thick with more stars than Cody had ever seen back home, where light pollution swallowed everything. No city glow here, no haze, just an endless scatter of light against the dark.

"Damn," he breathed.

Lukas climbed up after him and dropped onto his back, arms folded behind his head. "Found this spot sophomore year. After the knee surgery, when I couldn't sleep. I'd come up here and just look up. Nobody knows about it."

"Until now."

Lukas turned his head, met Cody's eyes in the dark. Something passed between them, quiet and sure.

"Until now."

Cody lay down beside him. The concrete was cold and hard against his back, but he didn't care. From up here, the world felt very far away. The Dean, the footage, the speech, all of it seemed like it belonged to someone else, some other version of him from hours ago.

They lay there in silence for a while, just breathing, just existing.

"Can I tell you something?" Cody said.

Lukas's ear flicked toward him. "Shoot."

Cody stared at the stars. He'd known this was coming. Maybe he'd even wanted it to.

"There was a guy," he said. "Brian. We called him Briar sometimes because of this stupid joke about a rabbit patch that doesn't matter now." He swallowed. "We were together for two years. The kind of thing where you start planning a future without realizing you're doing it."

Lukas didn't move. Just listened.

"He had a motorcycle. Loved that thing more than anything except maybe me." Cody kept his voice flat, easier that way. "One night he went out for a ride. Truck ran a red light. He survived, but the head trauma was bad. When he woke up, he didn't know who I was. Didn't know who he was. Total memory loss."

Lukas's breath caught. "Cody..."

"I stayed. For months. Visited every day, helped with recovery, tried to be there." He laughed, but there was nothing funny in it. "He never remembered. Not me, not us, not any of it. Eventually his family moved him to a facility upstate. I got a letter from his mom thanking me for my help." He paused. "That was it."

The wind cut across the empty stadium below, a low hum through the stands.

"He's still out there somewhere," Cody said. "Living some life that doesn't include me. But the guy I loved? He's gone. Has been for years." He exhaled. "That's one of my ghosts."

Lukas turned his head. "One of them?"

Cody kept his eyes on the sky. "Remember that night on the bench? When I told you about my mom, the pancakes, the lake?" He swallowed. "There's something I didn't tell you. About my dad. About what happened after she died."

Lukas was watching him. Waiting.

"I told you something in him broke. That he started drinking, couldn't look at me without seeing her." Cody's fingers traced the cold concrete. "What I didn't say was where all that grief went. All that anger." He swallowed hard. "He needed somewhere to put it. I was right there."

The wind picked up, sharp against his face.

"He broke one of my ribs when I was fifteen. Told the ER I fell off my bike." Cody shrugged, a small, tight motion. "After that I learned to stay out of his way. Kept my head down, counted the days until I could leave." He finally looked at Lukas. "So yeah. That's why I'm not exactly homesick."

Lukas's eyes were dark, unreadable. When he spoke, his voice was low. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It's done." Cody turned back to the stars. "That night, before Gem's text came through, you asked me what I'd tell my mom if I could go back one more time. I was about to answer."

"What were you going to say?"

Cody was quiet for a moment. "That I found people who give a damn." He turned his head, met Lukas's eyes. "But that was before. Before Graves, before that room, before you ran through a wall to get to me." His voice dropped. "Now I'd tell her I found someone worth staying for."

Silence stretched between them. Then Lukas shifted, moved closer until their shoulders touched.

"At the cabin," Lukas said quietly, "I told you that you were pack. That you don't get to trade yourself for us."

Cody turned his head.

"But standin' on that field today, waitin' for you to walk out there..." Lukas's voice roughened. "I realized I was lyin' to myself. Pretendin' it was just about pack. Just about keepin' you safe." He let out a breath. "When I turned around after that play and you were just there, ten feet away, alive, after everything... I knew it was more than that. Has been for a while."

His paw found Cody's hand in the dark, warm and solid.

"I ain't good at this part," Lukas said. "The words. But I need you to know. Whatever this is between us, I'm not runnin' from it anymore."

Cody's heart was doing something strange in his chest. He was tired of pretending he didn't know what it meant.

"I'm not going to lie to you." Cody swallowed. "I'm getting butterflies in my gut. They started in the woods when you found me. Got worse in the tunnels, on that walk, every time you put yourself between me and something dangerous." He paused. "And at the cabin, when I told you all the worst thing I ever did, and you looked at me and said 'that's what you did, it ain't who you are'..." His voice caught. "That's when I knew. Tonight just made it impossible to ignore anymore." He let out a breath. "They come out every time I hear you speak, Lukas. Every single time."

Lukas went still beside him. "Butterflies bite hard," he said, voice low. "Tell me where they sting."

Cody finally turned his head, met those amber eyes. "I'm going to talk plain. I'm falling for you, bud." He swallowed. "The people I've loved have a way of disappearing. One forgot me, one turned into someone I didn't recognize, one I had to bury. So I need to know, and I'm sorry if it sounds like an ultimatum, but with everything that's happened, I need something solid."

A cold gust swept across the roof. Cody's voice stayed steady, even if his hands weren't.

"If you say no, I won't be angry and I won't make it awkward. It'll be like it's been. But if it's yes..." He paused. "I'm willing to take it slow. See where it goes." He turned back to the stars. "Your move."

Silence stretched between them. Cody could hear Lukas's breathing, could feel the warmth radiating off his fur even with the November chill pressing up from below.

Then Lukas shifted. Moved closer until their knees touched.

"Cody." His voice cracked. He cleared his throat, forced it steady. "I'm not good at soft landings. But I feel the same pull. Been fighting it since the woods, and losin' that fight a little more every day. The tunnels. The cabin. That night you told us everything and I realized I'd follow you anywhere." He let out a breath. "By the time I broke down that door in B-7, I wasn't even pretendin' anymore."

Cody's heart slammed against his ribs.

"No ultimatum," Lukas said. "No pressure. Just us, this ledge, these stars." His paw squeezed Cody's hand. "We already did slow, Cody. We already did careful. I think we earned this." He squeezed again. "Yes. I'm right here. I ain't goin' anywhere."

Something broke open in Cody's chest, not painful, just release. He felt a tear slide down his temple before he could stop it.

"Yeah," he managed. "Yeah, we did."

Lukas rolled toward him, pulled him in until Cody's forehead rested against the thick fur of his neck. "Still here," he rasped. "Both of us. After all of it."

Cody held on. Let himself be held. The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and ancient, but right now they felt like witnesses.

When he finally pulled back, Lukas's thumb brushed the tear from his cheek, fur soft against skin.

"That one's mine," he murmured. "I'll keep it."

Cody laughed, wet and broken. Then he leaned in and kissed him.

He kissed Lukas like he'd been waiting his whole life and didn't want to wait another second. Like every wall he'd ever built had finally come down. Lukas made a sound deep in his chest, something between a growl and a gasp, and pulled Cody closer. Cody's fingers found the thick fur at the back of his neck and held on.

The world went away. The roof, the stadium, the whole damn week. There was just warmth and pressure and the taste of something he'd been too scared to name until right now. Lukas kissed him back like he meant it, like he'd been holding this in just as long, like letting go was the easiest thing he'd ever done.

When they finally broke apart, both of them were breathing hard. Lukas's eyes were bright, his tail thumping against the roof like he couldn't control it anymore and had stopped trying.

"Sealed," Cody whispered against his muzzle.

Lukas pulled back just enough to look at him, amber eyes searching his face like he was memorizing every detail. Then he lifted Cody's hand to his mouth and nipped his fingertip, gentle but deliberate. "Sealed."

For a long moment neither of them moved. Just breathing. Just being. The weight of the word settling between them like something solid, something real, something that couldn't be taken back.

Then Lukas tugged him down and they lay back together, closer this time, Cody's head on Lukas's chest, the wolf's arm wrapped around him like he was never letting go. The steady thump of Lukas's heartbeat against his ear was the best sound Cody had ever heard.

"We should head back," Lukas said eventually. "Security does rounds."

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

"Five more minutes," Cody said.

"Five more minutes."

They watched the stars. The empty stadium held them like a secret, and for the first time in a long time, Cody felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.
