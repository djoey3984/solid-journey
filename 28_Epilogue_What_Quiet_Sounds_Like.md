# Epilogue: What Quiet Sounds Like

Tuesday morning. Four days since the game, three days since Cody last set foot in an administrative building. Yesterday's statements had taken most of the afternoon, the whole pack retelling everything one by one while a recorder captured every word. Today Morrison had called just Cody back in, and Cody had insisted the others come too.

So here they were, crammed into the Associate Dean's office like they were waiting for a verdict. Benji perched on the arm of a chair, one leg bouncing. Gem stood by the window with her arms crossed, watching the quad below. Thorne took up most of the small couch, and Lukas sat beside Cody in one of the two chairs facing Morrison's desk, close enough that their shoulders touched.

Morrison shuffled papers, adjusted his glasses, cleared his throat. He was a deer, middle-aged, the kind of administrator who probably went into education wanting to help students and ended up buried in paperwork instead. Right now he looked like a guy delivering news he'd rehearsed six times in the mirror.

"First, the update on Dean Graves." Morrison folded his hands on the desk. "He's been formally charged and is currently incarcerated pending trial. Given the evidence, including Mr. Quillfoot's footage and Miss Kindler's documentation, the prosecutor is confident. You may be subpoenaed to testify, Mr. Guiles. We'll provide support through that process if it comes to it."

Cody nodded. He'd expected that part.

"Second." Morrison pulled a folder from his desk drawer and set it between them. "The university's legal counsel has asked me to present you with an offer."

Here it comes, Cody thought.

"In exchange for not pursuing legal action against Timberwood Hollow University..." Morrison opened the folder, turned it so Cody could read. "Full scholarship. Tuition, room and board, meal plan, books, and supplies. All covered for the duration of your undergraduate degree." He paused. "I understand you expressed interest in journalism. We have an excellent program. You'd be enrolled as a freshman starting spring semester, with provisional status until your documentation is fully processed."

The words sat there, black ink on university letterhead. Cody stared at them and felt something sour twist in his gut.

"So let me get this straight." His voice came out flatter than he intended. "Your dean kidnaps me, straps me to a table, and plans to do god knows what to my insides, and in exchange for not suing you into the ground, I get a free ride."

Morrison had the decency to look uncomfortable. "I understand how this might feel."

"Do you?" Cody leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice.

"Cody." Gem's voice, quiet from the window. He glanced over. She gave him a look that said take the deal, idiot.

Lukas's knee pressed against his under the desk, steady and grounding.

Cody looked back at the paperwork. Full scholarship, meal plan, books, the whole package. Everything he would have killed for back home, handed to him because a university was terrified of a lawsuit. It was hush money dressed up in academic language, and they all knew it.

But it was also a future. A real one. The kind he'd stopped believing in somewhere between his mother's funeral and his father's fists.

"Where do I sign?" The words came out tired, resigned, but he meant them.

Morrison's shoulders dropped about two inches with relief. He produced a pen, pointed to three separate lines, and Cody signed his name on each one. Cody Guiles. Cody Guiles. Cody Guiles. Like he was making himself real, one signature at a time.

When it was done, Morrison stood and extended his hand. "Welcome to Timberwood, Mr. Guiles. Officially."

Cody shook it. The grip was firm, and unless Cody's read on people had completely failed him, the warmth in Morrison's eyes was genuine. Not everyone at this university was a monster. Just the one who mattered most.

"Now get out of my office," Morrison said, and there was almost a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "Go enjoy your Tuesday."

The dining hall was loud and warm and smelled like fried food and cheap coffee, which was exactly what Cody needed after that office. They commandeered a table near the back, away from the windows, and within ten minutes Thorne had accumulated enough food to feed a small army.

"So you're official now." Benji was grinning so wide it looked like it hurt. "Cody Guiles, Timberwood University freshman. Got a nice ring to it."

"Sounds fake," Cody said, but he was smiling too.

"Sounds expensive." Gem sat down with a tray that held a salad and a cup of tea. "For them, I mean. Full ride? They must be terrified of what you could do to their reputation."

"Good," Lukas said. "They should be."

Thorne grunted in agreement, which for Thorne was practically a speech.

Benji launched into a retelling of the Jumbotron hack that Cody had now heard four times, but somehow it got more elaborate with each version. This time there were "military-grade firewalls" and "a three-second window before the whole system crashed" and Cody was pretty sure none of that was true, but Benji's quills were practically vibrating with pride so nobody corrected him.

Gem rolled her eyes but didn't interrupt. Thorne ate. Lukas's tail found its way around Cody's waist under the table, warm and solid, and stayed there.

"Oh!" Benji pointed his fork at Lukas. "Pay up, by the way."

Lukas raised an eyebrow.

"The bet. From Saturday." Benji turned to Cody. "How long before you stopped looking over your shoulder every five seconds. I gave you a month. Lukas said a week." He counted on his fingers. "Six days since you got here. He wins."

"You bet on me?" Cody's eyebrows shot up.

"We bet on your recovery," Benji corrected. "Very supportive. Very wholesome."

"I hate both of you." But Cody was fighting a grin, and losing badly.

"You love us," Benji said. "Also Lukas won, so technically he's buying lunch, which means I'm ordering dessert. Thorne, you want pie? I want pie. We're getting pie."

Thorne was already standing, headed for the dessert line. Benji scrambled after him.

Gem watched them go, then turned back to Cody and Lukas with something that might have been a smile. "You two are disgusting, by the way."

"We're not doing anything," Cody said.

"His tail has been around your waist for ten minutes." Gem gestured with her tea cup at the furry evidence in question.

Lukas didn't move it. "And?"

Gem shook her head, but she was definitely smiling now. "I'm happy for you. Both of you." She stood, picked up her tea. "I'm going to go make sure Benji doesn't order the entire dessert case. Try not to be too disgusting while I'm gone."

Then it was just the two of them, surrounded by the noise of the dining hall, Lukas's tail still warm against Cody's hip.

"So," Lukas said. "How's it feel? Being official."

Cody thought about it. "Weird. Good weird." He looked down at his tray, at the dining hall food that was now technically his dining hall food, at the table where his pack was sitting, at the wolf beside him who'd broken down a door to find him. "Like maybe I'm actually allowed to be here now."

Lukas's paw found his under the table. Squeezed once. "You were always allowed."

---

After lunch they walked. No destination, no hurry, just Cody and Lukas crossing campus in the early afternoon light. Lukas's tail had migrated from Cody's waist to a loose curl around his hip, and their shoulders bumped with every few steps. A few students glanced their way. A raccoon girl waved. Someone from the football team shouted something that was probably congratulations but might have been an innuendo. Lukas flipped him off without breaking stride.

It was halfway across the quad that Cody noticed it.

His brain was quiet.

Not scanning the crowd for threats. Not mapping exits or cataloging faces or running the constant background calculation of where danger might come from and how fast he could get away from it. For the first time in as long as he could remember, his head was just... still.

They rounded the corner by the old oak tree and there it was.

The science building stood gray and silent against the afternoon sky. Yellow tape crossed the main entrance in a bright X. A security officer sat on the steps, scrolling through his phone, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. And on the double doors, in black letters that caught the light:

**CLOSED**

Cody stopped walking.

Lukas's tail tightened around his hip. "You okay?"

Cody stared at the sign. He thought about fluorescent lights and cold metal and the sound of his own breathing echoing off tile walls. He thought about straps and needles and a snow leopard's patient smile. He thought about all the nights he might have spent in that building if things had gone differently, if his pack hadn't come for him, if Lukas hadn't broken down that door.

Then he looked at the CLOSED sign again. At the bored security guard. At the yellow tape that meant nobody was getting in, that the man who'd wanted to dissect him was sitting in a cell somewhere, that it was over.

"Yeah." He let out a slow breath, felt something loosen in his chest. "I really am."

Lukas bumped his shoulder. "Come on. Benji's buying dinner too."

"He lost the bet. You won." Cody poked Lukas in the ribs.

"And I'm makin' him pay for it all week." Lukas's tail gave a smug little wag.

Cody laughed, and it felt easy, felt real in a way laughing hadn't felt in years. He let Lukas pull him away from the science building, away from the yellow tape and the locked doors and everything they represented.

They walked through campus in the afternoon light, a wolf's tail around his waist and nowhere left to hide.

He didn't need to anymore.
