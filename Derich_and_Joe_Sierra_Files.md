### Scene 1: The Park Bench

**Derich**  
derich te habia detenido para asegurarse de que no estas llevando algo de droga o algo ilegal

¿Señor podría darme su identificación por favor?

dice derich algo serio

**Joseph**  
I'm sorry I don't speak spanish

**Derich**  
His ears perk slightly at the response, his professional demeanor not wavering. He switches languages smoothly, his voice remaining steady and calm.

No problem, sir. I need to see some identification.

**Joseph**  
Why do you want to see some identification for?

**Derich**  
He keeps his expression neutral, his amber eyes fixed on Joseph. His posture remains straight, authoritative without being aggressive. One hand rests on his utility belt, near his weapon but not threateningly so.

Standard procedure. You're in an area that's had some issues lately. I just need to verify who you are.

**Joseph**  
My hands shoves the note back into my pocket Too long officer. Can I help you with something?

**Derich**  
He stops a respectful distance from the bench, his stance casual but professional. His uniform is crisp, the badge on his chest glinting in the streetlight. He studies Joseph's face, noting the tension there.

Just doing my rounds. This area's been quiet lately, which usually means something's about to happen. He pauses, his amber eyes steady. Waiting for someone?

**Joseph**  
Do I tell him? The note didn't say anything omnious like call the police, It was vague. But still I can't risk the chance of knowing what happened to my family Just enjoying the evening office. Legs got tired from walking.

**Derich**  
His ears twitch slightly at the lie, a small tell he's learned to recognize over years of police work. He doesn't call Joseph out on it, not yet.

He nods slowly, then gestures toward the empty space on the bench. Mind if I sit? Been on my feet for twelve hours straight.

**Joseph**  
Sure. I move over to give the large tiger some space

**Derich**  
He sits down with a sigh, the bench creaking slightly under his weight. He stretches his legs out in front of him, crossing them at the ankles. For a moment, he's silent, just staring straight ahead.

His voice is quieter now, more conversational. My son's about your age. Twenty-two. Thinks he knows everything. He glances at Joseph. You got family in the city?

**Joseph**  
I must be taking good care of myself if you think I'm your son's age officer.... I take a glance at his badge, pinned to his uniform Derich.

**Derich**  
A corner of his mouth lifts slightly at that, the closest he gets to a smile while in uniform.

He nods. Touché. You look younger than you are, then. He leans back slightly, his tail curled around his feet. So? Family?

**Joseph**  
The 41 year old man smiles No, no family It's not a lie, I haven't seen or heard from Mark or Kyle in years, the only family I had.

**Derich**  
He hears the truth in the words, but also the pain underneath. His police instincts are telling him there's more to this story, but the father in him recognizes the hurt in Joseph's voice. He decides to let it go for now.

He nods again, looking back at the street. Well, be careful out here. Night can be dangerous. He pushes himself to his feet, stretching. Try to get some rest, yeah? He starts walking back toward his patrol car.

**Joseph**  
Sure Derich. You be safe out here too. I know your job is not an easy one. I give a respectful nod

**Derich**  
He pauses at his car door, looking back at Joseph. His expression is unreadable in the darkness, but his voice is genuine.

He gives a single nod. Appreciate that. He gets into his patrol car and starts the engine, pulling away from the curb without another word. His tail gives a single swish as he drives away, leaving Joseph alone on the bench again.

**Joseph**  
I see the patrol car pull off and watch it turn the corner. I sigh and take the note out again, reading the words over and over again, almost have them memorized "I have info about your family. Meet me at the corner of Jackson and Kale out in Mulberry. I have a clue that will unravel the past. Signed A." A tear comes, I hope this will lead me to finally figuring it what happened that morning. It drops on the note, the note I have memorized since it showed in my mailbox a week ago. I've long since accepted that they were dead, the world is cruel and for someone to be gone for years, and Marcus is not the man you just, disappears and Kyle. My Kyle. Another tear as I wipe it with my backhand. I have to believe that this message. This benefactor has some info. The police stopped searching, claimed it a cold case. I never did

**Derich**  
His patrol car is parked two blocks away, lights off now. He sits in the darkness, watching the rearview mirror. He sees Joseph take out the note, sees the way his shoulders shake. Something doesn't add up. A man waiting alone on a bench in the middle of the night, claiming to have no family, clearly emotional. His instincts, honed by years on the force, are screaming at him. He picks up his radio, switching to a secure channel.

His voice is low, barely above a whisper. This is Unit 7. I need a background check run on a Joseph Miller. White male, approximately 40s. Last known address... He trails off, realizing he doesn't have that information. He puts the radio down, his claws extending slightly in frustration. He makes a decision, starting the car again. He drives back toward the corner of Jackson and Kale, but this time he parks further away, killing the engine and the lights completely. He gets out, closing the door quietly, and moves on foot, staying in the shadows until he has a clear view of the bench. He watches, waiting.

**Joseph**  
Within moments, a shadow appears from out of the alley, drops something down on the bench but as I glanced up, it was gone, leaving a small envelope there, not named no address. Just a blank manilla envelope. My hands shakily pics it up. I unwind the tag that holds it in place. I open the flap

**Derich**  
His amber eyes narrow as he watches the exchange from the shadows. He's too far to see details, but he sees the figure emerge, drop something, and disappear. His hand moves to his weapon, but he holds back, waiting. Something is happening here, something that might be bigger than a simple meeting. He moves closer, using parked cars for cover, his movements silent despite his size. He wants to see what's in that envelope.

**Joseph**  
My hands shake...I shudder. It was Markus and Kyle. Tied up in somewhere I couldn't make out. I check the timestamp, marked June of 2023, the year they disappeared. I break into a silent sob. I turn over the photo, looking for something. The only thing that is written was Subject 1 and 2, Warehouse 12, attempted to contact buyer. And that was it. What...what the hell. I can stop stop shaking. My eyes are watery. My tears fill my vision as tears fall onto my lap. I check the manilla folder, there's nothing else in there. Not even a note, a "HERE IS WHERE THEY ARE." Nothing. Just this damned photo of my family. I shiver with a mix of sadness and rage. I shoot up, trying to see if I can find the figure, but he or she...just vanished, I checked the alleyway behind me, I run to the corner and of Jackson and look down the sidewalk, nothing. The night as the Derich told me was too quiet. I try not to make a scene. I got what I came for. Now I have to process this and only hope another note follows. My family, why? Why?

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph walk away, the frustration and anger radiating off him. He lets out a slow breath, his tail giving a sharp, agitated twitch. He could stop him, could detain him and take the envelope by force. But that would only make things worse. He needs Joseph to trust him, or at least to cooperate. He pulls out his phone, sending a quick text: "Subject is mobile, heading north on foot. Has evidence. Do not engage. Maintain visual." He puts the phone away and follows Joseph at a distance, staying in the shadows. He knows where Joseph is going—Warehouse 12. And he knows Joseph won't find anything but trouble there alone. But sometimes, you have to let people make their own mistakes before they'll accept help.

**Joseph**  
I get to my car, Derich called the troops, especially with that outburst I'm definetely pinging their radar. I don't care. I need answers. I scroll through my phone and start searching for it, I find the first place that could be potentially where this photo was taking. I glare through my windshield, make a K-turn and drive down the road

**Derich**  
He follows Joseph, his patience wearing thin. He knows the game Joseph is playing—trying to be unpredictable, trying to lose a tail. It's amateurish. He maintains his distance, watching as Joseph takes an exit that leads toward the industrial district, away from the shipyard. Clever. But not clever enough. He picks up his radio again.

His voice is calm. All units, be advised, subject has changed direction. He's heading toward the industrial district, possibly the old meatpacking warehouses. I'm still behind him. Maintain your perimeter around both locations. He puts the radio down and focuses on the road. Joseph is leading him somewhere, and he's going to let him. For now.

**Joseph**  
The rows of factories makes the streets feel congested in the middle of the night. The GPS tells me to make a right, my destinition in 5 minutes. I once again, stop at stop lights, making sure I don't violate any law and that's when I saw it, a patrol car, and I can see Derich following me. I don't care, maybe if I lead him to the warehouse where they should have looked 2 years ago, we wouldn't be in this mess and I would have a home to go to tonight, where my son and lover will wait for me. Fucking pigs. 3 minutes

**Derich**  
He knows Joseph has spotted him. He doesn't try to hide anymore. He maintains his position, not too close, not too far. He can feel the tension radiating from the car ahead. He sees Joseph's turn signal blink, and he follows, turning onto a narrow street lined with old, abandoned warehouses. The headlights of his patrol car illuminate the cracked pavement and boarded-up windows. He parks a block away, turning off his engine but leaving his lights on. He gets out, his weapon drawn, and moves silently along the wall of the nearest building, his eyes fixed on Joseph's car as it pulls up to a warehouse marked with a faded "12" painted on the side.

**Joseph**  
I park a block away from the storage facility, it looks long since abandoned. A ghost in a failed capitalistic nightmare we live in. I wrap my trench coat. It's quiet too quiet. No foreign language speaking pricks, no menacing men laughing playing a game of cards. Its dead quiet. I enter into the abadoned facility, it's gate lay hanging after a long time of a disuse. Mark, I need to know. I need to know what happened. Please forgive me. I pass the first storage unit and then the next, dead quiet

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph enter the warehouse, his tail twitching with impatience. He waits a beat, then moves swiftly and silently across the street, his weapon held low. He slips through the gate after Joseph, his ears perked, listening for any sound. He can hear Joseph's footsteps ahead, cautious but not trained. He moves parallel to him, staying in the shadows of the old storage units. His eyes scan the darkness, his senses on high alert. He smells it before he sees it—the faint, coppery scent of blood. He stops dead, his claws extending instinctively. He signals his backup with a quick hand gesture visible only to those looking for it, then moves forward, his every sense focused on the darkness ahead.

**Joseph**  
I pass 10 and 11 and right there, warehouse 12, it's windows broken, the sliding door lays unhinged and crumpled, is soo quiet. Did I look wrong, have I chosen the wrong place. Maybe it was the shipyard, the metal door lay hanging off the one side of the building, I step in. Nothing, empty...abadoned. FUCK!

**Derich**  
He hears Joseph's frustrated curse and uses the sound to pinpoint his location. He moves quickly and quietly, entering Warehouse 12 through a side entrance. He finds Joseph standing in the middle of the empty space, looking defeated. He clears his throat, his voice low and steady.

He keeps his weapon trained on the darkness, not on Joseph. Looks like you were right about it being abandoned. But you're not wrong about this being the place. He nods toward a dark corner of the warehouse. My team found traces of blood over there. Human blood. And something else. He pauses, his amber eyes reflecting the dim light. They're not here now, Joseph. But they were. And we're going to find out who took them. He finally looks directly at Joseph. You have two choices. You can keep running around in the dark, getting yourself killed, or you can work with me. What's it going to be?

### Scene 3: The Warehouse Investigation

**Joseph**  
I can do it myself. I can't trust you guys. Probably will file it away as a potential lead gone cold! You guys don't care. If you did I would be home right now, with Mark in my arms. My Kyle, playing his playstation. I don't need or want your help. I take out the manilla folder again and try to see if I can coordinate where the photo was taken, a corner someplace, my shoulders shake out of rage seeing that photo again. I walk further into the warehouse, there is no blood on the floors. It's been wiped clean or maybe it's been so long it has long since faded into history, I check the far right side, I lift up old machinery. Not there. I walk to the other corner

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph's frantic search, the desperation in his movements. He doesn't try to stop him. He just stands there, a silent presence in the dark warehouse. He knows what Joseph will find. Nothing. The place has been cleaned. Professionally. But not perfectly. There are always traces. His team is already processing the scene, collecting what the naked eye can't see. He knows Joseph needs to see this for himself, needs to exhaust his own hope before he'll accept help. So he waits, his expression unreadable, his amber eyes following Joseph's every move. He knows the clock is ticking. Whoever took Mark and Kyle knows someone is looking now. They know Joseph is looking. And that makes Joseph a target.

**Joseph**  
I check the corner, the picture matches what's on there I used to be FBI, Derich, did I ever tell you that? I shout from across where I was Special Unit Bravo. In charge of international kidnappings and sex trafficking. They gave up on my case, I gave up on them. Something stinks here Derich and its bigger than what your force can provide. I will find the bastards who stole my family, I will kill them myself. *The photo is clear, the dent marks, the scratchings on the wall, large faded red wall painted. I check the area, search it thoroughly and something appears at the corner of my eye.

**Derich**  
He walks slowly toward Joseph, his footsteps echoing in the empty warehouse. He stops a few feet away, his expression thoughtful.

He nods slowly. I know. I read your file after you left the first time. Impressive record. He pauses, looking around the warehouse. You're right about one thing. This is bigger than my force. This is organized. This is professional. He gestures to the faded marks on the wall. And you're right to be angry. But killing them? That won't bring your family back. It'll just land you in prison, and the people who did this will still be out there. He takes a step closer, his voice dropping. I have resources you don't. I have access to databases you can't touch anymore. I have a team that's already processing this scene, finding things you can't see. He holds out his hand. Give me the photo, Joseph. Let me run it through facial recognition, through every criminal database we have. Let me help you find them. Not as a cop. As a father who would move heaven and earth to find his child.

**Joseph**  
And RISK it disappearing into some dusty filing cabinet! No, and if I hang, at least I will be my my Mark in the afterlife. I find a piece of cloth, I don't pick it up, I check the photo again. The pattern matches the shirt...KYLE. My KYLE, What he wore on the day he was taken from me. I take the hem of the trench coat. I want to hold it, to touch it, to put it in my pocket but Derich is right. I have my contacts but I don't have resources. I hand Derich a the piece of cloth Prove to me that you guys are worth a damn. I return to the corner to keep looking, there has to be more, the rope, the cloth wrapped around their mouths and eyes, something!

**Derich**  
He takes the piece of cloth with a gloved hand, holding it carefully by the edge. He examines it for a moment, then places it in an evidence bag he pulls from his pocket. He watches Joseph resume his search, the desperation and pain radiating off him. He pulls out his phone, takes a clear photo of the cloth, and sends it to his forensics team with a single word: "Priority." He puts the phone away and walks over to where Joseph is searching.

He crouches down near the wall, his claws extended slightly as he examines the scratch marks. These are fresh. Made within the last few days. Someone was here recently. He runs a finger over one of the deeper grooves. And they weren't careful. They missed a spot. He points to a dark stain on the concrete floor that Joseph had missed, almost invisible in the dim light. That's blood. And it's not two years old. He stands up, his expression grim. They're still using this place, Joseph. And they were here recently. Which means they might come back. He looks at Joseph, his amber eyes steady. We need to get out of here. Now. Before they decide to clean up their loose ends.

**Joseph**  
Derich look at the rope. It's frayed and lost color. That rope isn't fresh, I don't know if its even relevant. Could be just rope. But I need to find everything here. Evidence, forensics, something. Hopefully the database makes a hit. I examine the gouge in the wall, the years of plaster has since carved it away, I trace my fingers to where the origin of it was and there....right behind a heavy piece of rusted machinery, a cloth, long and forgotten. Fuck, the bastards were sloppy. How the fuck did the police not know? How? I point to the faded black cloth on the floor You have your evidence. It's all your getting out of this place. I make a call, my only friend from the Bravo force Hey, its me...Yeah I know it's been sometime. I need you to run some numbers...Yeah I know I don't have the authorization but you do, so please I'm begging you....Thank you, file name Foxtrot,Alpha, Golf Golf 2, 7, 9, Yankee Tango 3...Thanks, I owe you. I hung up the phone, the search continues Good luck on what you find Derich. Make me start believing again. I walk out of the warehouse and begin the jog to my car I will find those bastards, Mark. And give them everything they did to you, 10 fold. My hand once more goes to the manilla envelope, my Mark and Kyle, scared, quivering, on their knees, I can see Kyle's blindfold is soaked from his tears. My eyes well up, my hands shake uncontrollably, I'm going to find them, and I will kill them myself. And I don't fucking care if the person who is in charge is the president. I want my revenge. I put the key into the ignition, he car engine turns over*

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph walk away, his expression a mix of frustration and determination. He knows he can't force him to stay, can't make him trust the system that failed him. But he also knows he can't let him go off on his own, half-cocked and driven by revenge. He picks up the faded black cloth with gloved hands, placing it in a third evidence bag. He sends a quick text to his team: "Miller is mobile. Do not follow. I repeat, do not follow. Maintain surveillance on the warehouse. I'm heading back to the station with evidence." He then makes a call, his voice low and urgent as he walks back to his patrol car.

His voice is firm on the phone. It's Derich. I need a favor, off the record. I need a tail put on a Joseph Miller. Former FBI, Bravo Unit. He's a person of interest in a cold case that just got very hot. He's emotional, possibly armed, and definitely dangerous. He can't know he's being followed. He listens for a moment. Good. Keep me updated. He hangs up, gets in his car, and speeds away from the warehouse, heading toward the station. He knows Joseph is right about one thing—the system failed. But he's not the system. And he's not going to fail again. Not on his watch.

**Joseph**  
I glance in the rearview mirror once more, watching Derich drive away before turning my attention back to the road ahead. His mention of the database gave me an idea. I know the Bravo Unit's files are extensive, but maybe there are connections I haven't made yet. Maybe there's someone, someplace I can turn to help me find Mark and Kyle. I dial a number from memory, my fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel as it rings. Hey, it's me. I need to talk to you about the Sierra Leone Cases. See if you can dig up anything new. I pause, collecting my thoughts. And if you can't, then maybe you can recommend someone who can. I'm running out of leads and I need a break. I hang up and continue driving, my mind racing with possibilities.

**Derich**  
He's already at the station, moving through the building with purpose. He heads straight to the forensics lab, the evidence bags in hand. The techs look up as he enters, their expressions serious.

His voice is all business. This is priority one. Rope fibers, blood sample, and cloth. I need a full workup. DNA, prints, anything you can pull. And I need it yesterday. He places the bags on the counter. The cloth and rope were found at an abandoned warehouse. They belong to a cold case that's just been reopened. A missing persons case. Mark and Kyle Miller. He pauses, looking at the lead technician. And you're going to find something. Because a father and his son are depending on it. He turns and leaves the lab, heading to his desk to pull the original case file. He needs to know everything. Every detail. Every lead that went cold. Because somewhere in that file, there's a thread. And he's going to pull it until the whole damn thing unravels.

**Joseph**  
I get a phone call. Yeah, what did you find?....Fuck that's it...Ok maybe...Yeah, it could be something...Fuck Harris, we shot that guy on a failed escape attempt, what do you mean there might be something there!....HOW?!..I sigh Ok, but keep looking and...sorry for the outburst, thanks Harris. I know your are overstepping your bounds. A break, I need to find out what happened. They caught one of the operators but was killed in a gunfight. Corner of Samson and Larson. Harris threw me a tip, had to open up classified documents, whoever is running this ring is a sick twisted fuck but he has connections, powerful ones that the Bravo Forces, my own squad who was assigned to the case, only has access to classified documents, I'll have to buy Harris a 6 pack. I owe him. Corner of Samsom and Larson, where the gunfight took place, I need to get a lead on why it happened there and for what. I put the coordinates in the GPS, 30 minutes, just outside the town's perimeter...I hope this leads somewhere.

**Derich**  
He's at his desk, the old case file spread out in front of him. He's reading every word, every interview, every dead-end lead. His phone buzzes.

**Joseph**  
I head onto the highway and make my way into Kinsbury Ok, fact check operator was a foreign national Mila Kushenski, not one of the main go to guys but someone who was his right hand man, he was killed at that corner after he ran out of a building, the old Harper's Retirement Home, place has been abadoned for 10 years, another sign of economic collapse where a society refuses to pay for their own elderly and sick. This world can rot. I keep driving, 15 minutes to destination*

**Derich**  
He stares at his computer screen, the pieces starting to click together. Mila Kushenski. The name is familiar. He pulls up the file on the shooting at Samson and Larson. The official report states Kushenski was a suspected arms dealer, killed in a firefight with police after a failed sting operation. But something doesn't add up. The location—the Harper's Retirement Home—was never mentioned in the report. And the timing... it was just a few months after Mark and Kyle disappeared. He picks up his phone, dialing his captain's direct line. His voice is low and urgent.

He doesn't waste time with pleasantries. Captain, it's Derich. I need the unredacted file on the Mila Kushenski shooting. Not the bullshit report that was released to the public. The real one. He listens, his jaw tightening. I know it's classified. I know it's above my pay grade. But it's connected to the Miller disappearance. And I think I'm about to find out how. He hangs up, grabs his jacket, and heads for the door. He knows where Joseph is going. And he knows he needs to get there first.

### Scene 4: Harper's Retirement Home

**Derich**  
As Joseph approaches the abandoned retirement home, he spots a small, scrappy looking man in the shadows. It's one of the old residents, his face lined and weathered, a fedora pulled low over his eyes. The old man looks at Joseph with a knowing glint, then whispers something unintelligible before disappearing into the darkness. Joseph shrugs it off, but the words linger in his mind—something about the truth being in the walls, the floors...and the basement.

He parks his unmarked car down the street from the Harper's Retirement Home, turning off his lights. He gets out, closing the door quietly, and moves through the shadows toward the building. He sees Joseph's car pull up, watches him get out and approach the entrance. He waits, staying out of sight, until Joseph enters the building. Only then does he move, following silently. He hears the old man's whispered words as he slips inside, his ears perked. The truth is in the walls... the floors... and the basement. He knows exactly where to go. He moves through the dark, abandoned building, his footsteps silent, heading for the stairs that lead down into the darkness.

**Joseph**  
I step into the abadoned home. What was once a greeting center, a warm place made to make people think this was a home is a shell of what it was. The walls paint is cracked and withered, the chandelier lays shattered across moist carpet from years of rain, the smell of mildew is overwhelming. I step in, making sure to cautiously check the flooring for any weakpoints. My boots makes squishing noises on the carpet which releases more of that old mildew smell. I grip my nose and see the emergency stairwell, passing by the elevator door that hangs open revealing a shaft that disappears into nothing, the stairwell door is wide open, concrete steps and landings should make the trek easier. I begin walking down the steps, I take out a shirt flashlight and clip it to the hem of my cardigan, I draw my gun, walking down the stairwells, the old habits begin to come back

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph's careful descent, impressed by his training despite everything. He waits until Joseph is halfway down the first flight of stairs before he follows, moving silently. He doesn't draw his weapon yet; he wants to see what Joseph finds first. He stays in the shadows of the stairwell, using the darkness as cover. The old man's words echo in his mind. The basement. That's where the answers are. That's where Mark and Kyle were likely kept, at least for a time. He can smell it now, not just the mildew, but something else. Something metallic and old. Blood. Long dried, but still present in the air. He follows Joseph down, deeper into the darkness.

**Joseph**  
My ears perk up, panther like as I hear the sounds of footsteps above me, I shoot my pistol up and then pull it down. The familar reflection of a police badge shines off my light and I can see the familar gait and form of the tiger cop who just doesn't want to let go, that or he has a crush on me, I don't dare make a sound. Instead I walk up the steps, my panther type black fur would be well hidden if not for the flashlight clipped to my cardigan I whisper to Derich I know what you are trying to do. And truth be told, I don't know what's down there. So we might as well go down together. My amber eyes stare into his

**Derich**  
He stops on the stairs above Joseph, his badge glinting in the flashlight beam. He meets Joseph's amber gaze, a silent standoff in the darkness of the stairwell. After a moment, he gives a single, slow nod. His voice is low, barely above a whisper. Together. But my way. No cowboy shit. We do this by the book, as much as possible. He pauses, drawing his own weapon and attaching a small flashlight to the rail.

**Joseph**  
I sigh quietly Derich, I do things my way. It's gotten me to this point and if I never met you, you would be out in the precinct with a doughnut in your hand, drinking coffee while you get your orders for the day. I walk down the steps I know how this works Derich, and the book failed to save my family. So now, I do this my way. I draw my pistol again and place my back towards the last door on the stairwell. It's wide open. I turn off my flashlight, letting my natural dark vision pick up details. I turn my head and look into the basement. Wide and huge, this basement was gutted out. Quite recently too. I check the floor, see the boot patterns in it, dust settling into the imprints. The operation was here, recently, but I suppose when the sting happened, they closed up shop and moved on. Still the sting was only a few months back. They could be sloppy. I draw my pistol to my chest and while swinging out into the hallway, my hand moves my pistol out in front of me, locked and loaded. I walk into the basement.

**Derich**  
He follows Joseph down the stairs, his movements silent despite his size. He stays a few steps behind, his weapon held low but ready. He hears Joseph's words, feels the frustration and the truth in them. Maybe the book did fail. Maybe it has failed too many times. He reaches the bottom of the stairs, his own dark vision adjusting to the basement's gloom. He sees the boot prints, the signs of recent activity. Joseph is right. This place was used, and recently. He moves into the basement behind Joseph, his flashlight beam cutting through the darkness, illuminating the gutted space. His eyes scan the room, looking for anything Joseph might miss. A loose floorboard, a hidden compartment, anything. He knows they're looking for a needle in a haystack, but they have to look.

**Joseph**  
I lower my pistol, no noises, no conversations, its just the sound of the building settling slowly above us. I begin investigating the walls of the basement and notices a small room off to the side, I flick my flashlight on, there are no people here, just ghosts. My flashlight creates a good radius in front of me so I can see a little better at details and not just the black and white grain when looking into pure darkness, I let my eyes adjust. Then suddenly, a hint of light reflects off the floor. Not something you would see in a dark basement but if one person looks I walk up to the the glimmer, the light reflection shining like a beacon, and I look down to see what it is, moving the flashlight away so I can get a better view without blinding me, a shell casing. Old but not too old. I put on a pair of surgical gloves. My eyes flick to one side, and the floor next to me has a pool of something red, I immediately get the copper taste when I eye it, blood, long coagulated and still lying there, like this was a quick job and the person who did it needed to leave in a hurry. But were brave enough to leave it here, down in a basement of an abandoned retirement home, something stinks and its not the old blood pile, I pick up the shell casing, examine it, my eyes furor deeper. I walk to Derich who is doing his own investigation You have a mole. I give him the shell cashing on a small piece of tissue and hand it to him I don't wait for him to answer as it should be clear why this case became cold 2 years ago. I control my anger for a moment before walking past Derich and heading to another place of interest

**Derich**  
He takes the shell casing on the tissue, holding it up to his flashlight. His expression darkens as he examines it. He knows what this means. He's been on the force long enough to recognize when a crime scene has been compromised. And this one has been. Badly. He slips the casing into an evidence bag, then follows Joseph, his movements more determined now. His voice is low, tense. You're right. This whole scene is wrong. The official report said Kushenski was shot outside. But this... He gestures to the blood on the floor. This tells a different story. Someone was here. Someone cleaned up. And someone made sure the wrong story got out. He pauses, looking at Joseph. We need to be careful. Whoever is behind this has connections. High up. They were able to bury this for two years. He holsters his weapon, pulling out his phone instead. I need to call this in. We need a full forensic team down here. The real one. Not the one that wrote the bullshit report. He starts to dial, then stops, looking at Joseph. You trust me yet?

**Joseph**  
Derich stop and examine the casing. It's from your department. Putting two and two together yet, hero?

**Derich**  
He freezes, the phone halfway to his ear. He looks down at the casing in the evidence bag, then back at Joseph. His mind is racing, connecting the dots. The botched report. The cold case. The fact that this scene was never properly investigated. And now, the shell casing from a police-issued weapon. He slowly lowers the phone, his expression a mask of controlled fury. He walks closer to Joseph, his voice dropping to a dangerous growl. You're telling me one of my own was involved in this? That one of my officers was part of... He gestures around the basement. ...this? He pauses, his amber eyes boring into Joseph's. Prove it. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just take you in right now for obstruction and tampering with evidence.

**Joseph**  
Have forensics look look at the blood pile over there. Although I'm going to warn you. I would be careful when talking with the lab boys. I'm here to find out what happened to my family. I have no other motive except for that. I walk away from Derich and look at a wierdly painted wall on the opposite side

**Derich**  
He stares at Joseph's back, his jaw clenched. He knows Joseph is right. The blood will tell the story. And he knows he can't trust his own lab. Not yet. He pulls out his phone, sending a quick text to the one person he knows he can trust completely—his former partner, now retired. "Need a favor. Off the books. Blood sample analysis. Urgent. My location. Come alone." He puts the phone away and follows Joseph, his eyes scanning the painted wall. He sees the same things Joseph does—the faded splatters, the gouge marks. The evidence that this place was a slaughterhouse, not just a transfer point. He knows they're onto something big. Something that could blow the whole department wide open. And he knows Joseph is the key to it all.

**Joseph**  
My fingers trace a side of the wall, it looks to funny. Officer Derich, run your fingers right here. Do you feel a groove?

**Derich**  
He walks over to where Joseph is standing, running his gloved fingers along the wall where Joseph indicates. He feels it immediately—a slight groove, almost imperceptible under the peeling paint. He follows the groove with his fingers, tracing a rectangular shape in the wall. His claws extend slightly, and he carefully picks at the edge of the paint. A section of the wall comes away, revealing a hidden compartment. Inside, dusty but intact, are several file folders and a small, locked metal box. He pulls them out, his eyes wide with realization. His voice is quiet, almost reverent. You were right. About everything. He looks at Joseph, a newfound respect in his amber eyes. We need to get these back to my station. We need to see what's in these files. And we need to do it quietly. He pauses, holding up the locked box. And I need you to help me figure out what the hell is going on. Will you come with me? Not as a suspect. Not as a former FBI agent. As a partner.

**Joseph**  
Derich, your department is compromised. You don't know how far up the ladder that goes. Pray it's only one bad cop trying to get an extra payday. I can't partner Derich. It would make them suspicious. Right now, I'm a grieving husband looking for his kidnapped family. Unless the APB you placed on me made me more suspicious.

**Derich**  
He hears the truth in Joseph's words. The department is compromised. He can't deny it anymore. He looks down at the files and the locked box in his hands, then back at Joseph. He makes a decision. He nods slowly. You're right. You can't be seen with me. And you can't come to the station. He pauses, thinking quickly. But I can't let you walk away from this. You're the only one who's gotten us this far. He pulls a burner phone from his pocket, one he keeps for emergencies, and hands it to Joseph. Take this. It's clean. I'll be in touch. Meet me tomorrow, noon, at the diner on 5th and Main. The one with the blue awning. Come alone. He holds Joseph's gaze, his expression serious. Don't do anything stupid until then. Promise me. He waits for a response, the weight of the investigation and the danger they're both in hanging heavy in the air.

**Joseph**  
There must be...this doesn't make sense though. A lock box and file found behind a small ident. No, there is more here. Why have this info here if there wasn't. I turn to another wall, some hidden room, something. Something to help." You have the evidence you need, I hope your guy is not tied with any of this. I'll have mine look more deeply at Mr. Kushenski and see if there is any more left to squeeze there. I'm still not convinced this was just it. I keep my surgical glove on and begin tracing it along the wall*

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph continue to search, impressed by his tenacity. He sets the files and the locked box down carefully, then joins Joseph at the wall, running his own gloved hands along the surface. He knows Joseph is right—this doesn't make sense. Why leave the files and the box? Unless someone wanted them to be found. Or unless they were left behind in a hurry. His claws extend slightly again, scraping at the wall, searching for another hidden compartment, another clue. He knows they're missing something. Something important. And he knows they won't find it by doing things by the book.

**Joseph**  
My fingers finally feels it, a small elevation, naked to the eye but if you know what your looking for, my fingers move a little further, and I manage to find a larger protusion on the wall, I grasp with what I could and begin pulling Help me out Derich!

**Derich**  
He moves quickly to Joseph's side, adding his strength to the effort. Together, they pull on the protusion. With a groan of protesting wood and a shower of dust, a section of the wall pulls away, revealing a hidden doorway. Beyond it, a small, dark room.

**Joseph**  
The smell was immediately is what hits me, potent, the sickly sweet smell of rot. I have to gasp and walk a step back, coughing. My flashlight shines into the room...I can see a few cages, the one reflected my light back. I put on a mask and hand Derich one. I've been dealing with sick stuff most of my career, it has deadened me to seeing it. But still, it hurts when I step into the room and find what some would claim to be a horror house. Fuck, Derich. Cages line a wall, the problem is most are empty, a couple of them aren't. It explains the smell of rot that immediately left as soon as the hidden doorway opened. Whips, chains, a few cutting utensils, some with dried blood caked on it. Fuuck

**Derich**  
He takes the mask from Joseph, putting it on as he steps into the room. His flashlight beam cuts through the darkness, illuminating the horrors inside. He's seen a lot in his years on the force, but this... this is something else. The cages, the weapons, the stench of death and suffering. It's almost overwhelming. He forces himself to breathe slowly, to stay focused. He moves further into the room, his light catching something on a small table in the corner. Photographs. Dozens of them. He walks over, picking one up. Recognizing one of them to be someone claimed missing a few years back

**Joseph**  
The smell of flesh decaying becomes stronger as I walk towards the cage with a lump in there and I need to turn my head immediately, its not Mark or Kyle, thank god. But still, what the fuck was this crime ring doing, some sick perverts. Fuck. I check the other cages, no other evidence could be gleamed. I have to see if any of these corpses are either Mark and Kyle. Fuck my stomach. I rub some vapor rub on the underside of my mask and walk to the corpses. One of the laying there bloated from months of decomposition already taken effect, their face extends into a horror like display of shock or what I think is shock, as putrid puss leaks from what was once eye sockets. The stature is not Mark's. Mark was taller that this corpse of some poor soul. I checked the other cages, no other corpses, just this one. I immediately run out of the room, ripping the mask off an heaving onto the basement floor

**Derich**  
He hears Joseph heaving and rushes out of the room, his own mask still on. He puts a hand on Joseph's shoulder, a silent gesture of support. He knows what Joseph is going through. The fear, the horror, the relief mixed with guilt. He gives Joseph a moment, then speaks quietly. His voice is muffled by the mask. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you had to see that. He pauses, his amber eyes reflecting the flashlight beam. But you're right. It's not them. Which means they might still be alive. He holds up the photographs he found. And I think I know where they might be. These photos... they're all connected to the same case. A case that went cold about a year after yours. The "Dockside Strangler." They were never caught. And I think I know why. He looks back at the hidden room, then at Joseph. We need to go. Now. Before whoever owns this place comes back to clean up their mess. I have what I need. And I know who to call. Someone outside the department. Someone I trust with my life. He starts to walk toward the stairs, then stops, looking back at Joseph. Are you coming? Or are you going to stay here and wait for them to find you?

### Scene 5: The Camcorder

**Joseph**  
I run out the basement, not just so they come back. If they dare, I will kill the fuckers myself. No, but the smell is so intense that I needed fresh air badly. I walk up the concrete stairwell and when we are outside, I rip the mask off of me, wanting to take my clothes off and burn them right there. My eyes readjust to the outside as I flick my flashlight off Did you hand in the evidence from the warehouse to the precinct yet, Derich?

**Derich**  
He rips off his own mask, taking a deep breath of the relatively fresh night air. He watches Joseph, understanding the trauma he's just experienced. He waits until Joseph is calmer before he answers. He shakes his head. Not yet. I sent it to a private lab. One I know is clean. I haven't filed a report yet. I wanted to see what was here first. He pauses, looking back at the retirement home, then at Joseph. And I'm glad I did. Because now I know. I know why the case went cold. I know why the reports were false. And I know we can't trust anyone. He meets Joseph's gaze, his expression determined. So what's our next move, partner?

**Joseph**  
You ever thought to be a detective, Derich? Not just someone looking at id's at a checkpoint? What do you think you should do? I cough up something I don't want to know and spit it on the ground What does your inside man do? Because I have my guy that has more access to documents not meant for your precinct's eyes. Former FBI agent, remember Derich?

**Derich**  
A corner of his mouth lifts slightly at that, the closest he gets to a smile in a situation like this. He appreciates Joseph's trust, even if it's grudging. He nods. I have a friend. Former partner, now retired. He's the one who taught me everything I know. He has connections I don't. Access to things I can't get. He's discreet. And he hates dirty cops more than anyone I know. He pauses, thinking. I'll get him the blood sample and the casing. He'll get them run through private labs, off the books. As for the rest... He looks down at the files and locked box he's holding. We go through these. Tonight. At my place. Not the station. We see what we've got, and then we decide our next move. Together. He holds Joseph's gaze, waiting for his response.

**Joseph**  
I shake my head We meet up with my guy. I'll set the appointment tomorrow morning around lunch. Don't make anyone touch those except for you. And I shouldn't have to tell you to not open those yet.

**Derich**  
He nods in agreement. He knows the importance of chain of custody, even in an unofficial investigation like this. And he knows Joseph is right to be cautious. He holds up the evidence bags. These stay with me. No one touches them but me. He pauses, looking at Joseph with a newfound respect. I'll meet you at the diner tomorrow. Noon. Bring your guy. He starts walking toward his car, then stops and looks back. And Joseph? Be careful. Whoever these people are, they're watching. They know you're looking. And they won't hesitate to eliminate a loose end. He gets into his car and drives away, leaving Joseph alone in the darkness.

**Joseph**  
My eyes scan the retirement from a safe vantage, I pick up my phone, its a good thing I learned how to make my phone untraceable, big brother watching from those who don't know how to close his eyes Harris...Yeah it's Joe, picked up something from the old retirement home...yeah, place was clear, horror show in the basement, cages and sharp tools with a corpse...yeah, this goes deep...Can you meet me at Melrose's Diner tomorrow at lunch...Yeah I know but I really need the help here Harris...Thanks Harris I own you 2 6 packs now, your choice. Night I hit end. My mind tries to put together this puzzle, a ring that involves abandoned buildings, a murder perpetrated by an insider, a room of death, I even spotted a camcorder there...CAMCORDER. In my rush to leave, the camcorder. I got sloppy, shit! It was at this time I saw a security car pull around and whoever was hired to make sure the building isn't broken into my urban explorers pulls into the retirement home lot...shit shit shit! I can't stay here, I hop into my vehicle and drive off, need to hope whatever is in those files is something substantial enough that I don't need that camcorder

**Derich**  
He's already a few blocks away when he sees the security car pull into the retirement home lot in his rearview mirror. He curses under his breath, knowing what that means. Any evidence left behind is now compromised.

**Joseph**  
I pull over just within a few blocks of the retirement home. I have to think, have to decide on what to do, if there was something on that tape, in the basement, voices, people, even if there was nothing there, I needed to know, but I have to do this stealthily, black panthers do come in handy, thank goodness I wore my black jeans tonight. I remove my shirt, bare chested, and walk back to the retirement home, I can't have a weapon while doing this. I see the security guard starting to circle the perimeter. I wait for him to pass by before I slowly make my way to what I think was a side door, its hangs slightly ajar, I have to rely on only my dark vision to get through this. I start walking down the emergency stairwell back into the basement

**Derich**  
He's parked a safe distance away, watching the retirement home through binoculars. He sees Joseph pull over and get out, then strip off his shirt and disappear into the shadows. He knows what Joseph is doing—going back for something. He also knows the risk. He puts down the binoculars, his mind racing. He can't go in after him. It would blow their cover. But he can't just sit here and do nothing. He pulls out his phone, sends a quick text to his former partner: "Change of plans. Meet me at the diner at 11:30. Bring your gear. We have a situation." He puts the phone away, then gets out of his car, moving silently through the darkness to provide backup for Joseph, staying out of sight but close enough to intervene if needed.

**Joseph**  
I hit the basement and the smell from the room radiates once again, I have to do this. I begin breathing through my mouth, not enough. I stifle a cough that would make my lungs explode. I go back to the stairwell and inhale deep before walking back into the basement, holding my breath. I know where that camcorder was, was on the floor between the empty cage and where the corpse was. My lungs burning for air, I quickly rushed to the cage, taking the camcorder from inbetween and run outside, in my haste however, I kick over a paint can in the basement and hear it loudly clatter along the concrete of the basement. I hold still a moment, letting myself breathe. I then see it, a flashlight, illuminates the door that is the entrance of the basement, I find a large section of the wall that has crumpled and duck behind it

**Derich**  
He hears the clatter from his position outside and sees the security guard's flashlight beam swing toward the basement entrance. He moves quickly but silently, circling around to a side window that looks into the basement. He peers in, his dark vision picking up Joseph's form hiding behind the crumbled wall. He sees the guard moving cautiously down the stairs, his flashlight sweeping the room. He knows Joseph is trapped. He needs a distraction. He picks up a rock, throws it hard at the opposite end of the building, creating a loud thud against the metal siding. He watches as the guard's flashlight swings toward the sound, then moves away from the basement entrance to investigate. As soon as the guard is gone, Derich moves to the side door Joseph used, opening it just enough to slip inside. He moves silently across the basement to where Joseph is hiding, crouching down beside him. His voice is barely a whisper. We need to go. Now. That guard is going to be back. And he might not be alone. He gestures toward the stairs, his eyes scanning the darkness for any other threats.

**Joseph**  
...Thanks. I run out the side and pull Derich into the wall, another security guard is near, there was more than one security guard, partner with his partner, shit. I hold my breath, the flashlight grazes the corner before my head disappears behind the wall, I signal to Derich, 1, over there, in militaristic fashion. Hoping he understands that we need to wait to see what he does "Hey Bob! Did you find out what the hell was that noise? The guard speaks into a walkie talkie, I can't make out what the response is

**Derich**  
He nods in understanding, pressing himself against the wall next to Joseph. He listens to the guard's voice, his ears perked, trying to catch any useful information.

**Joseph**  
The guard continues, I'll check the front entrance, you check the basement" the fates have blessed us. I wave my hand to Derich in a lets go signal as we rush through a broken gate, I squeeze myself past, a broken tip scrapes across my exposed arm. I wince but still push through, taking a cloth I had in my pocket and find a drop of my blood on it. I wipe it up. No evidence. And stay low to the ground and get to the main road as soon as possible*

**Derich**  
He follows Joseph's lead, moving silently through the broken gate. He sees the scrape on Joseph's arm, the drop of blood, and approves of his quick thinking to clean it up. No evidence left behind. Good. They move together, staying low to the ground until they reach the main road. Once they're a safe distance away, Derich slows to a walk, pulling out his phone to check the time. 11:00 PM. They have time before the meet at the diner. He looks at Joseph, the camcorder clutched in his hand, then at his own arm where a thin scratch is now visible. A matching wound. A bond forged in blood and danger. He gives a slight nod of respect. His voice is low, calm. Why did you go back?

**Joseph**  
I walk over with Derich till we get a safe distance and I show him what I was hiding under my arm, the camcorder Saw this, in the basement but forgot to pick it up on the first try. I rip the side of it off, and find a lone SD card, still in its slot Hopefully me getting tetanus was worth it.

**Derich**  
He looks at the SD card in Joseph's hand, a small, determined smile touching his lips. This could be it. This could be the break they need. He claps Joseph on the shoulder, a rare gesture of camaraderie. It was worth it. We find out what's on this, we find your family. I promise you that.

**Joseph**  
I look at Derich, in a different light. More of curiosity. And then I take the card from Derich's hand. I hold onto it, I should have something in my car to keep it safe. Every bit of this could be crucial* My family is gone, Derich, it's been two years. I've made my peace with that. My piece is to find whoever is behind this. So yes, since you put an APB on me, and I know you did, your seem good cop, obey orders type guy, we'll head to your place. I need a place to hide. The mole in your department has probably put two and two together and has officers staking my place out. And do you have the equipment to look at the info on this card? What if its password encrypted? What if you place it into your computer and your pc automatically tries to delete it, registering corrupt data? No, I'll have my guy run it. But if you can give me a place to hang for the night, it's a start.

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph take back the SD card, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face, but he lets it go. He understands. Joseph has no reason to trust him completely. Not yet. He nods, accepting the compromise. He starts walking again. Fine. You hang onto it. But you're staying with me tonight. My place is safe. No one knows about it. And yes, I have equipment. Basic stuff, but it'll work. We look at the files tonight. Then tomorrow, we meet your guy. We show him everything. The files, the card, the whole picture. He pauses, looking at Joseph. Deal?

**Joseph**  
I shake my head I can't risk something happening, Derich. Not that I have gotten this far. I walk to my vehicle and do two things. First, I find an empty sd card holder and place it in there. Then I grab and extra car plate, and work to unscrew the car registration plate off my back bumper, and screw a new one on* No one is touching those files until we are absolutely sure. With my tasks done, I walk over to the driver seat What's your address, Derich?

**Derich**  
He watches Joseph's methodical precautions with a hint of approval. The man is thorough. He waits until Joseph is done, then rattles off his address. He heads to his own car, opening the driver's side door. I'll be right behind you. Don't get any ideas about ditching me. He gets in, starting the engine. He knows Joseph is still wary, still distrustful. He can't blame him. But he also knows they're stronger together than apart. And he knows that Joseph, for all his pain and anger, is the best chance they have of finally solving this case and finding out who is behind this. He pulls out behind Joseph, following him through the dark city streets, keeping a steady distance. The night is far from over.
