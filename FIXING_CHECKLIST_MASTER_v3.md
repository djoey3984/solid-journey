# Timberwood Hollow FIXING Checklist

**Purpose:** Run this checklist AFTER drafting each new chapter to catch and fix mistakes before presenting to the user.

**CRITICAL: READ THIS CHECKLIST THOROUGHLY BEFORE EVERY DRAFT**

---

## PROSE STYLE RULES (ALL NON-DEAN SCENES)

**"Layman's terms with a creative touch"** - This is the DNA of the story's voice.

### The Rule:
- Grounded, down-to-earth prose
- Nitty gritty concrete details
- Very small bit of flourish (not flowery)
- If a simile/metaphor uses an abstract concept, rewrite it with something concrete everyone has seen

### Do NOT:
- Use flowery or poetic language
- Repeat phrases, similes, or metaphors (if you used it once in the story, it's done)
- Write literary prose that calls attention to itself
- Use abstract imagery ("like embers that forgot how to glow")
- **NEVER use "X thing. Y thing." or "Not X. Not Y. Just Z." patterns**
- **NEVER use staccato sentence structures - prose should FLOW NATURALLY**
- **NEVER use Earth references** — No NFL, NBA, real-world brands, countries, celebrities, etc. This is an anthropomorphic world. Use generic equivalents (pro players, the league, etc.)
- **NEVER use vague cop-out descriptions** — No "something he couldn't name," "a scent he couldn't place," "a feeling he couldn't describe." Either describe it concretely or reframe the sentence. If the character can smell/see/feel it, the reader should too.

### BANNED PHRASES (Never use these):
- "gray light"
- "heat in chest" / "coal in chest" / any heat-in-chest variation
- "jaw tightened" / "jaw tightening"
- Any "X thing. Y thing." pattern
- Any "No X. No Y. Just Z." pattern
- **"Woke up to sunlight + coffee brewing" combo** — The tired romance novel opener. Sunlight through curtains + smell of coffee wafting = BANNED. Coffee in other contexts is fine. Just not this package deal.

### LUKAS BODY HEAT RESTRICTION:
**Lukas runs hot, but don't beat the reader over the head with it.**
- **MAXIMUM: 1-2 heat/warmth/furnace references per chapter**
- If you've mentioned his heat once, find OTHER ways to show his physical presence:
  - Weight (mattress dipping, furniture groaning, floor creaking)
  - Size (shoulders filling doorways, having to duck, furniture too small)
  - Sound (claws clicking, voice rumbling, tail thumping)
  - Scent (cedar, musk, soap, sweat after practice)
  - Texture (rough paw pads, dense fur, winter coat)
  - Movement (easy grace, predator efficiency, threat assessment)
- The heat detail is EARNED once per chapter. After that, use the other five senses.

### DO:
- Use concrete objects everyone recognizes (dollar-store curtains, gas station postcards, birthday candles)
- Keep it blunt and sensory
- Let the unexpected comparison do the work, not pretty words
- Track every simile/metaphor used so you don't repeat
- **USE EXCLAMATION POINTS when the moment calls for it** - intense scenes need punch, don't be afraid of "!" in dialogue (e.g., "Lukas, wait!" not "Lukas, wait.")

### Kill Lazy Descriptions:

**The Problem ISN'T the word "was."** The problem is LAZY descriptions that don't DO anything — flat prose that just states facts without sensory texture, concrete imagery, or immersive detail.

**Lazy descriptions:**
- State a fact and stop
- Use generic adjectives ("quiet," "empty," "dark," "cold")
- Don't engage the senses
- Don't build atmosphere or character voice
- Could be written by anyone about anything

**Good descriptions:**
- Have sensory texture (smell, feel, sound, taste)
- Use concrete similes everyone's experienced
- Build character voice into the POV
- Weave anthro biology into background naturally
- EARN their place — every detail works

| ❌ Lazy (Does Nothing) | ✅ Alive (Does Work) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| The campus was empty and quiet | The campus spread below them like a blueprint someone had forgotten to populate — brick paths cutting between dark buildings, lampposts throwing circles of orange onto grass that looked black in the pre-dawn |
| The stadium was a dark shape against the treeline | The stadium hunched at the edge of campus, bleachers skeletal against the treeline |
| The turnoff had no sign | The turnoff was nothing — a gap between two pines with branches hanging low enough to scrape the roof, no sign, no mailbox, just a dirt track swallowed by shadow |
| It smelled like dust and old wood | The smell hit him — cedar and dust and something underneath, the ghost of five people eating pizza out of boxes and planning a takedown. The pack had been here. The walls remembered. |
| The cabin sat in a clearing | The cabin looked like it had grown there instead of been built — single story, wood siding weathered to the same gray as the rocks behind it |
| Cold air carried the smell of pine | The cold had a smell here — wet stone, pine sap, the mineral bite of snow that hadn't fallen yet but was thinking about it |
| The quad was mostly empty | The quad still wore that abandoned look it got before nine — a few joggers, a maintenance cart humming past the library, someone's coffee steam rising from a bench |

**Test each description:** Would a reader feel like they're THERE? Can they smell it, hear it, feel it? Does it build mood or character? If not, punch it up.

### Examples:
- ❌ "painting the quad in shades of orange and gray" (flowery)
- ✅ "that ugly sunset orange you see on gas station postcards" (concrete)

- ❌ "like embers that forgot how to glow" (abstract, pretty)
- ✅ "like birthday candles that won't stay lit" (concrete, everyone's seen this)

- ❌ "a hollowed shell of movement" (poetic)
- ✅ "just some robot going through the motions" (grounded)

- ❌ "No destination. No agenda. Just this." (AI pattern)
- ✅ Rewrite to flow naturally in prose

- ❌ "Shoulders tight. Jaw set. The softness gone." (staccato)
- ✅ Combine into flowing sentence

- ❌ "something warm underneath that he'd never been able to name" (vague cop-out)
- ✅ "the faint musk of wolf fur after a long day" (concrete, specific)

### Simile/Metaphor Tracking:
When fixing chapters, note every unique comparison used. If it appears twice, cut one. Each image gets used ONCE in the entire novel.

## ANTHRO BIOLOGY RULES — THE GOLD STANDARD

**The Problem:** Characters can feel like humans wearing animal costumes instead of actual animals living civilized lives.

**The Goal:** Deep biological texture woven into EVERY scene. Not occasional mentions — consistent, immersive detail that makes readers forget these aren't real.

**Remember:** They wear clothes, boots, use phones, have jobs. Modern life. But the animal is ALWAYS there.

### THE STANDARD: EVERY LINE DOES DOUBLE OR TRIPLE DUTY

Don't just mention a wolf sat down. Show HOW a wolf sits, what it does to the environment, what his body is doing while he's "just sitting."

| ❌ Basic (Does One Thing) | ✅ Gold Standard (Does Three Things) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Lukas slid into a booth facing the entrance. | Lukas slid into a booth facing the entrance, his heavy frame making the vinyl groan and the wood beneath it creak. He didn't look at the menu. His ears were too busy tracking the rhythm of the kitchen: the clatter of a plate being set on the pass, the hiss of something hitting a hot grill. His tail tucked neatly against the leg of the booth, out of the aisle. |
| Lukas woke up alert. | Lukas's eyes opened. No slow climb to consciousness. One moment asleep, the next his pupils had contracted to pinpoints and his ears had snapped toward the door, toward the window, back to Cody. Threat assessment in under a second. |
| Lukas ate quickly. | Lukas ate the way he did everything. Efficient, focused, no wasted motion. The Lumberjack Special wasn't breakfast to him; it was fuel for a body that ran hotter and burned through calories faster than Cody could imagine. He cleared half his plate before Cody had finished his eggs, and he did it without ever fully taking his attention off the room. |
| Lukas crouched by the creek. | Lukas crouched at the edge, dropping into that easy squat that would have burned Cody's thighs after thirty seconds. He dipped a claw into the current, watching the water split around it. |

### FOOTWEAR RULE
**All anthros wear footwear.** Boots, shoes, sandals — some form of footwear is always present. This means:
- **NO "claws clicking on floor/concrete/tile"** — they're wearing shoes
- **NO bare paws on ground** unless explicitly in a private/intimate setting (bedroom, shower)
- Use boot thuds, shoe scuffs, the creak of rubber soles instead
- Claws can still be visible/mentioned (extending past gloves, clicking on counters when hands are braced) but not on walking surfaces

### FOUR LAYERS OF BIOLOGICAL TEXTURE

**1. PHYSICAL IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENT**
- Vinyl groaning under weight
- Mattress dipping hard
- Heavy boot thuds, floor creaking under mass
- Heat radiating through fur (Cody feels it)
- Bench seat pushed back as far as it goes, knees still near dashboard

**2. MULTI-SENSORY TRACKING (Always On)**
- Ears tracking kitchen rhythm: clatter, hiss, wet slap of dishrag
- Nostrils flaring, sorting scents: frost from woodsmoke from Cody's skin
- Eyes cataloguing room while doing something else
- "Reading the place the way Cody might read a room full of strangers"

**3. BODY MANAGEMENT IN SPACE**
- Tail tucked against booth leg to stay out of aisle
- One leg hanging off bed (too big for furniture)
- Crouching easy and natural vs. Cody's knees protesting
- Weight settling different indoors vs outdoors ("less contained")
- "The kind of automatic adjustment that came from years of fitting a predator's body into spaces built for smaller frames"

**4. BEHAVIORAL BIOLOGY WOVEN INTO ACTION**
- Watching raccoon couple while ordering (not looking at menu)
- Threat assessment in under a second upon waking
- Hands knowing the turn before eyes confirm it
- Smelling for nests in the chimney flue
- "His whole body was listening"

### SCENT — MAKE IT BIOLOGICAL

❌ Basic: "Lukas's nose twitched, pulling in the morning."

✅ Gold Standard: "Lukas's nostrils flared, the black leather of his nose damp and working as he sorted through the morning. Frost. Woodsmoke from a chimney somewhere across campus. The iron tang of old pipes from the building's ventilation. And underneath it all, threaded through everything else, what Cody could only assume was himself."

### TEMPERATURE — WOLVES RUN HOT

Lukas is a furnace. Use this consistently:
- "The heat of him cutting through November like a space heater wrapped in fur"
- "Felt the heat radiating through the fur even in the cold room"
- "The cold sliding off him like it had forgotten how to bite" (vs. Cody hunching into jacket)
- "Fuel for a body that ran hotter and burned through calories faster"

### ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS INSTINCT — "LEASH ON / LEASH OFF"

**Campus (Leash On):**
- Controlled movements
- Ears more deliberate
- "Shoulders squaring up. Grip tightening on the wheel. The leash going back on, one invisible notch at a time."

**Forest/Cabin (Leash Off):**
- "This was Lukas with the leash off"
- More fluid movement
- Ears swiveling independent of each other
- "His whole face changed as the forest air hit him"
- "Fingers uncurling from fists he probably didn't know he'd been making"
- "Like his body knew this ground intimately, every root and dip and soft spot"

### TENSION/THREAT RESPONSE

When something is WRONG, layer the biological response:
- Hackles rising along back of neck (fur standing straight up)
- Weight dropping into haunches (ready to spring)
- Sound from throat "that predated words" (not quite a growl, something older)
- Muscles unlocking one at a time when tension fades
- Ears fixed on something Cody can't see/hear/smell

### BACKGROUND ANTHROS NEED TEXTURE TOO

❌ Basic: "A badger sat at the counter eating eggs."

✅ Gold Standard: "A badger sat alone at the counter, his broad back hunched over a plate of eggs, fork scraping methodically while one ear tracked the sizzle from the kitchen."

❌ Basic: "A raccoon couple sat in the corner."

✅ Gold Standard: "A raccoon couple murmured to each other in a corner booth, her ringed tail curled around the base of her chair, his paws wrapped around a mug he kept lifting to his nose like the steam was the best part."

### SPECIES-INFORMED CHARACTER

| Character | Species Trait | How It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Lukas | Wolf pack instinct | Protective, needs his people close, reads group dynamics, runs hot, constant threat assessment |
| Thorne | Bear patience | Waits, observes, moves when it matters, massive physical presence |
| Benji | Hedgehog anxiety | Curls inward when stressed, quills rise with emotion |
| Gem | Fox cunning | Analytical, always thinking three steps ahead, tail flicks reveal emotion |

### PER-SCENE CHECKLIST (EXPANDED)

For EVERY scene with anthro characters:
- [ ] Physical impact on environment (weight, heat, sound of movement)
- [ ] Multi-sensory tracking (what are ears/nose doing?)
- [ ] Body management in space (tail position, fitting into furniture, posture)
- [ ] Behavioral biology in action (threat assessment, reading rooms, instincts)
- [ ] If Lukas: temperature contrast with Cody/environment
- [ ] If forest/cabin: "leash off" behavior shift
- [ ] Background anthros have at least one species-specific detail
- [ ] Does EVERY description do at least double duty?

---

## CODY'S HUMAN SENSORY FILTER

**Cody is human.** When writing from his POV, remember he doesn't have the refined sense of smell that anthros do. He interprets the world through **sight, sound, and touch** — not scent.

### WHAT CODY CAN DETECT:
- **Sight:** Visual details, body language, movement, fur texture, steam rising off Lukas
- **Sound:** Dialogue, claws clicking, tail thumping, heartbeat when pressed close
- **Touch/Tactile:** Weight, texture of fur/fabric, heat radiating, physical pressure

### WHAT CODY CANNOT DETECT:
- Subtle scent changes (pack bonds, emotional shifts, territorial marking)
- "Musk" or species-specific smells (unless strong/pungent)
- What Lukas is "reading" from someone's scent

### EXCEPTIONS (When Cody CAN smell something):
- **Pungent environmental smells:** Bacon grease, coffee, burned food, locker room soap
- **Strong food smells:** Duck broth, pizza, cooking
- **Sudden/overwhelming changes:** Smoke, blood, something rotting
- **Close physical proximity:** When pressed against Lukas, he might notice the general warmth/texture, but not "sort scents" the way a wolf would

### LUKAS DETECTING CODY'S SCENT:
Lukas CAN smell Cody's emotions — but write it from Cody's observation:
- ✅ "Lukas's nostrils flared, trying to catch something in Cody's scent that would tell him the truth."
- ❌ "Cody could smell the tension rolling off Lukas." (Cody can't do this)

### REPLACING SCENT WITH OTHER SENSES:

| ❌ Scent-based (wrong for Cody POV) | ✅ Visual/Tactile (correct for Cody POV) |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "the sheets held the deep musk of wolf fur" | "the sheets held the deep, heavy warmth of him" |
| "still smelling of exertion and locker room soap" | "steam still rose off his shoulders, fur damp in patches" |
| "the musk of a hard practice clung to him" | "his winter coat looked darker where the moisture clung" |

---

## CODY'S PATTERN BRAIN

**Cody notices things.** His POV should reflect a mind that's always cataloguing, connecting dots, reading tells. This is consistent with his character sheet.

**What Cody's pattern brain does:**
- Reads Lukas's physical tells (single tail thump, ears swiveling, shoulders squaring)
- Notices environmental details others would miss
- Makes connections between observations
- Compares what he's seeing to what he expected

**Examples:**
- "Lukas's tail gave a single wag, quick enough that someone else might have missed it."
- "Cody found himself watching instead of asking. Whatever Lukas heard out there, his whole body was listening."
- "By the time they hit the main road, Cody could see him changing. Shoulders straightening. Grip tightening on the wheel."

**The pattern brain should:**
- Make observations feel earned (Cody notices because he's PAYING ATTENTION)
- Show character growth (early Cody is hypervigilant for threats; later Cody reads emotional cues)
- Never feel like the author explaining things — it's Cody processing his world

### ⚠️ DO NOT OVERUSE "FILED IT AWAY" PHRASES

**By Chapter 10, readers KNOW Cody has a pattern brain. Stop announcing it.**

**BANNED/LIMITED phrases (max 1-2 per chapter TOTAL, preferably zero):**
- "filed it away"
- "stored it with the rest"
- "catalogued it"
- "put it in the same drawer"
- "added it to the list"
- "his pattern brain noticed"
- Any variation of "Cody noticed and saved for later"

**Instead: SHOW the pattern brain in action without narrating the mental filing cabinet.**

| ❌ Announcing It | ✅ Showing It |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Cody filed that away." | Just let the observation land and move on. |
| "He stored it with the other things he couldn't explain." | End on the observation itself. Reader gets it. |
| "His pattern brain catalogued the detail." | "The detail stuck." (if you must) |
| "Cody added it to the growing list." | Just show him noticing. Trust the reader. |

**Rule of thumb:** If you've shown Cody noticing something specific, the reader already knows he noticed. You don't need to narrate him putting it in a mental filing cabinet every single time.

---

## NARRATOR SEEDS / COSMIC INTERFERENCE

**When the Narrator/Guiding Hand intervenes, make it PHYSICAL, not just "weird."**

The supernatural should feel like a biological, sensory experience — something that affects the body, not just the mind.

**Layer the physical experience:**
- Air pressure changes (ears popping, vacuum-sealed feeling)
- Sound cuts out mid-note (not just "silence" — describe what STOPS)
- Visual distortion (water frozen mid-ripple like jagged glass)
- Physical response from characters (Lukas's hackles, sounds that predate words)
- Even breath stops fogging (the cold itself holding still)

**Example — The Creek Scene:**

❌ Basic (just weird): "The creek stopped. The birds went quiet. Something felt wrong."

✅ Gold Standard (physical and terrifying): "The water froze mid-ripple, surface gone jagged like cracked glass, and the air pressure changed so suddenly Cody's ears popped. The birds cut out mid-note. No sound at all except Cody's own heartbeat, suddenly the loudest thing in the forest, thudding against his ribs like it was trying to get out."

**Key principle:** If the Narrator can pause reality, the reader should FEEL the pause in their own body.

---

## PARAGRAPH CONSOLIDATION RULE

**Consolidate into paragraph form. Only use line breaks when:**
1. Another character speaks
2. An emotional beat happens

**Do NOT break paragraphs for:**
- Every new thought
- Every action
- Dramatic effect (unless truly earned)

**Example of WRONG formatting:**
```
Cody noticed it halfway across the quad.

Lukas wasn't leading.

That was new.
```

**Example of CORRECT formatting:**
```
Cody noticed it halfway across the quad. Lukas wasn't leading. That was new.
```

---

## SCENE TRANSITIONS (NO MOVIE CUTS)

**This is a novel, not a screenplay.** Scenes should flow into each other with transitional prose, not hard cuts.

**Use scene breaks (`---`) ONLY for:**
- Significant time jumps (hours or days, not minutes)
- POV changes
- Major location shifts that can't be bridged with a sentence

**Do NOT use scene breaks for:**
- Moving from one room to another
- Walking across campus
- Short time gaps (a few minutes)
- Any transition that can be handled with a sentence or two

**Example of WRONG (movie cut):**
```
"I'll walk you." She grabbed her bag.

---

The campus store was on the second floor.
```

**Example of CORRECT (flowing transition):**
```
"I'll walk you." She grabbed her bag.

They crossed campus to the Student Union. The campus store was on the second floor.
```

**Rule of thumb:** If you can bridge two scenes with one transitional sentence, do it. Save hard breaks for genuine jumps in time or perspective.

---

## NO CAMERA DIRECTION LANGUAGE

**This is prose, not a screenplay.** Characters don't "turn toward" things like a camera panning. They move, they walk, they act.

**Avoid these camera direction phrases:**
- "turned toward" / "turned to face"
- "looked over at"
- "glanced toward"
- "shifted his gaze to"
- "his eyes moved to"

**Replace with actual movement or tighter phrasing:**

| WRONG (camera direction) | RIGHT (prose) |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| "turned toward the door" | "headed for the door" / "walked to the door" |
| "turned toward Westfall Hall" | "headed for Westfall Hall" |
| "turned to face him" | "faced him" / "stopped and faced him" |
| "looked over at Lukas" | "Lukas was already grinning" (show what they see) |
| "his eyes moved to the window" | "Outside, the quad was empty" (just describe it) |

**Rule of thumb:** If a character needs to see something, either have them move toward it or just describe what's there. The reader's "camera" follows the POV character automatically.

---

## NO FLOATING DIALOGUE RULE

**Every line of dialogue needs grounding.** If a character speaks, the reader needs to see or feel something alongside it. Dialogue should never float alone on a line without context.

**Ground dialogue with:**
- **Action** (leaned back, crossed arms, poked him in the ribs)
- **Expression** (eyebrows shot up, fighting a grin, nose wrinkled)
- **Tone descriptor** (the words came out tired, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice)
- **Physical reaction** (tail wagged, gestured with her cup, shoulders dropped)

**Example of WRONG (floating dialogue):**
```
"Do you?"
```

**Example of CORRECT (grounded dialogue):**
```
"Do you?" Cody leaned back in his chair, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice.
```

**More examples:**

- ❌ `"You bet on me?"`
- ✅ `"You bet on me?" Cody's eyebrows shot up.`

- ❌ `"And I'm makin' him pay for it all week."`
- ✅ `"And I'm makin' him pay for it all week." Lukas's tail gave a smug little wag.`

- ❌ `"Where do I sign?"`
- ✅ `"Where do I sign?" The words came out tired, resigned, but he meant them.`

**Exception:** Rapid-fire back-and-forth dialogue in tense scenes can occasionally have untagged lines IF the speaker is crystal clear from context and the rhythm demands it. But when in doubt, ground it.

---

## CALLBACK/REFERENCE RULE

**If referencing a previous event, location, or detail, you MUST be able to cite the chapter and line.**

- Don't invent callbacks to things that didn't happen on the page
- If you can't point to where it was established, don't reference it
- When in doubt, keep the reference vague OR ask for verification

**Example of WRONG:**
```
"the same table they'd claimed that first night with the pizza"
(If this pizza night isn't in an actual chapter, don't reference it)
```

**Example of CORRECT:**
```
"a table near the back, away from the windows"
(Generic - doesn't claim a specific memory that might not exist)
```

---

## NEW LORE INVENTION RULE

**Adding NEW lore is encouraged — but flag it and ask first.**

When drafting, if you invent something new (family members, backstory details, locations, relationships), you should:
1. **Flag it** during the fixing checklist pass
2. **Ask** — "Hey, I added X. I couldn't find it in the character sheet/timeline. Does this work?"
3. **Introduce it naturally** — have characters react with surprise so readers know it's new info too

**Example of GOOD lore drop:**
```
"Thorne's got a thing this weekend. His sister Mariella roped him into some hiking trip."
"Wait, Thorne has a sister?" Cody couldn't picture it.
"He wasn't hatched in a lab."
```
(Cody's surprise = reader's surprise. Lore dropped, no one was the wiser.)

**Example of BAD lore drop:**
```
"Thorne's sister was always dragging him places."
(Assumes reader already knows about sister — feels like a retcon)
```

**Key distinction:**
- **Callbacks** = referencing something that should already exist → VERIFY it exists
- **New lore** = adding something that could exist but hasn't been mentioned → ASK first, introduce naturally

---

## PHASE 2: FULL CONTINUITY PASS

### Part 1 (Chapters 1-14)
- [ ] Read through completely, flag any issues
- [ ] Verify timeline consistency
- [ ] **Verify time of day matches between adjacent chapters** (morning/afternoon/night flows logically)
- [ ] Check character knowledge (who knows what, when)
- [ ] Confirm Gem is always "Miss Kindler" (student, not doctor)
- [ ] Verify Cody's clothing (cardigans, canvas jackets, NO HOODIES until after Chapter 18)
- [ ] Check "Wolfy" and "Odi" nicknames are NOT used yet (introduced organically later)

### Part 2 (Chapters 15-24) - Dean Saga Fixes
- [ ] Read through completely, flag any issues
- [ ] Verify Dean's behavior matches new character profile (Part 2 only villain)
- [ ] **Verify time of day matches between adjacent chapters** (morning/afternoon/night flows logically)
- [ ] Check Rumi's motivation matches chat logs ("clean shot to roster, full ride, guaranteed spot at Nationals")
- [ ] Confirm Lukas-Rumi history is consistent (best friends age 6 to middle school, **Rumi outgrew Lukas** - Rumi drifted away chasing status/crowds, Lukas stayed grounded)
- [ ] **Rumi-Dean communication: Update existing chapters to match Ch 18.5** - Rumi has direct contact with Dean (card with direct line). Review chapters where Rumi appears and ensure this is consistent. His complicity makes him more tragic.
- [ ] Verify portal resonance mechanics are consistent (amplifying over 3 days, 63-hour window)
- [ ] Check Friday deadline is maintained throughout
- [ ] Confirm science building closure matches Dean's exit
- [ ] Ensure Dean's removal is complete (no dangling threads requiring him in Part 3+)

### Cross-Part Continuity
- [ ] Characters who appear in both parts are consistent
- [ ] Timeline flows naturally between Part 1 ending and Part 2 beginning
- [ ] Emotional arcs continue (Cody's growth, Lukas's walls coming down)

---

## PHASE 3: FORMATTING PASS

### Em Dash Removal (IN PROSE ONLY)

**⚠️ FIRST STEP OF EVERY FIXING PASS: Do a literal search for "—" (em dash) in the document. Find EVERY instance. Fix ALL of them before any other checks. No excuses. No "I think I got them all." SEARCH. This includes dialogue interruptions and trailing thoughts at end of sentences. ⚠️**

- [ ] Part 1: Find and remove all em dashes (—) from prose
- [ ] Part 2: Find and remove all em dashes (—) from prose
- [ ] Replace with periods, commas, colons, exclamation points, or ellipses as appropriate
- [ ] Dialogue interruptions: use ellipses, commas, periods, or exclamation points — NOT em dashes
- [ ] Trailing thoughts at end of sentences: ellipses or period, NOT em dashes
- [ ] Maximum 2 hyphens per chapter (only for standard English like "forty-eight")
- Note: Em dashes are fine in notes, outlines, checklists, documentation — just not in the novel prose itself

### Style Consistency
- [ ] Unified scene break format (`---`) throughout
- [ ] Chapter headings consistent
- [ ] No formatting artifacts from document conversion

---

## PHASE 5: POLISH PASS

### Tone Matching
- [ ] Verify "layman's terms with a creative touch" voice throughout
- [ ] Check similes use concrete objects (not abstract concepts)
- [ ] Confirm casual, working-class references match Chapter 1 style
- [ ] No flowery or poetic prose in main narrative
- [ ] Grounded, nitty gritty details with minimal flourish

### No Repeats Rule
- [ ] Create master list of all similes/metaphors used in manuscript
- [ ] Each unique comparison used ONCE only in entire novel
- [ ] If duplicate found, rewrite or cut one instance
- [ ] Track phrases that feel distinctive (don't reuse)

### Dual Protagonist Tracking
- [ ] Cody's arc: Broken shell → Thawing → Full Odi
- [ ] Lukas's arc: Guarded wall → Bricks loosening → Armor off
- [ ] Both arcs visible in every chapter

### Redundancy Check
- [ ] Varied action words (not repeated "grabbed," "nodded," "glanced")
- [ ] No repeated beats (both characters doing same action)
- [ ] **"X thing. Y thing." NEVER USE**
- [ ] **"Not X. Not Y. Just Z." NEVER USE**
- [ ] **NO REPEATED SIMILES/METAPHORS** - each unique image used once in entire novel
- [ ] **NO REPEATED DISTINCTIVE PHRASES** - if it's memorable, it only appears once
- [ ] **NO STACCATO SENTENCE STRUCTURES** - prose flows naturally
- [ ] **NO FLOATING DIALOGUE** - every line of dialogue needs grounding
- [ ] **NO CAMERA DIRECTION LANGUAGE** - no "turned toward," "looked over at," etc.

---

## PRE-DRAFT CHECKLIST

20. [ ] **Lukas runs HOT - temperature contrast with Cody/environment in every scene**
21. [ ] **"Leash on/leash off" - campus vs forest behavior shift must be visible**
22. [ ] **Background anthros get species-specific texture too (not just main characters)**
23. [ ] **Scent is BIOLOGICAL - nostrils flaring, nose damp and working, sorting layers of smell**
24. [ ] **Threat response is LAYERED - hackles, haunches, sounds that predate words, muscles unlocking one at a time**
25. [ ] **CODY'S PATTERN BRAIN - he notices tells, catalogs details, makes connections (this is his POV)**
26. [ ] **NARRATOR SEEDS are PHYSICAL - air pressure, sounds cutting mid-note, visual distortion, body responses**
27. [ ] **Concrete similes use REAL objects - "bruised violet like storm clouds," "jagged like cracked glass"**
28. [ ] **EVERY line of dialogue is grounded - character is DOING something while speaking**
29. [ ] **CODY'S HUMAN SENSORY FILTER - he uses sight, sound, touch - NOT refined scent detection (only pungent/sudden smells)**
