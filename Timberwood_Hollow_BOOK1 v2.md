# Chapter 1: The Spark That Hides

Cody Guiles wakes up feeling like crap. The sun sneaks through his dollar-store curtain like an unwelcome guest. He stays flat on his back for an extra second, just long enough to hate it, before he forces himself to sit up. His mattress makes that sad squeaky sound old beds make. The sheets are twisted from how he sleeps these days: one knee bent up, one shoulder dug in, like his body's trying to curl around something that isn't there anymore. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he feels small and wound-up tight, like one of those toy cars you pull back before letting go. His brown hair is shaggy and messy, and those eyes, the ones his mom used to say had "little bits of sunshine" in them, just look tired now. He wipes his face with his palm and stares at the wall for a second before forcing himself to stand.

He stares into the dusty floor mirror. The guy looking back isn't really him anymore. Just some robot going through the motions to keep everyone else happy. He's built solid enough, with decent shoulders that used to mean something when he wore pads. Captain, junior year. The guy who saw plays before they happened, who read defenses like other people read street signs, who made the calls that mattered. State semifinals. Scholarship talk. A future that actually looked like something.

Then came senior year. One bad moment. One swing he couldn't take back. And just like that, the guy in the mirror became someone else.

His eyes remind him of those birthday candles that won't stay lit no matter how many times you try. His hair's grown out too long, plastered to his forehead from sleep like a bad haircut in a school photo. His skin's about as colorful as printer paper, lips squeezed tight, jaw locked like he's waiting for life to punch him in the face again. Standing there, he notices how his neck, his shoulders, his hands are all just there. Present but hollow, like props in a play about someone else's life. The crappy light in his room highlights all the stuff he hates seeing: the bags under his eyes, the way he can't even fake a real smile anymore, how his mouth stays in that stubborn line that says "I'm fine" when he's anything but. Looking at himself is like seeing a stranger wearing his skin. Some dude who used to be a real person with dreams and stuff, not just a walking collection of ways to get through the day. Whatever spark he had is just a story he tells himself now, like Santa Claus or the idea that things might actually get better someday.

He grabs his clothes off the floor like he's picking up after a little kid. His T-shirt's got that soft feeling from being washed a million times, wrinkled where he dropped it yesterday. His pants are those jean-looking things with elastic ankles that gave up being blue a long time ago. The socks on his nightstand are just sad. Gray, with holes starting at the toes like they're trying to escape. He yanks the shirt over his head, wiggles into the pants, and pulls on the socks, smoothing them like he's petting a stray cat. His sneakers used to be white, maybe, but now they're the color of dirty dishwater. He ties them with the muscle memory of someone who's done it half-asleep a thousand times. Standing up, he checks himself in the mirror that hasn't been cleaned since Obama was president. Just another guy going through the motions because the world doesn't care if he wants to or not.

He opens his bedroom door to what looks like a trash tornado hit. Garbage bags were piled up against the walls like they were trying to hold the place together, and there was so much junk on the floor you couldn't even tell what color the carpet was supposed to be. His dad was passed out in the old recliner again, looking like a scarecrow that someone had knocked over and forgotten about. His shirt was all yellow around the neck, with food stains making a connect-the-dots puzzle down the front, and dark patches under the arms. His hair was stuck to his head like he'd gone swimming in cooking oil, his beard was growing in every direction except the right one, and his face was shiny with sweat. Empty bourbon bottles were scattered around his feet like bowling pins after a strike, and the whole place smelled like a mix of booze, B.O., and yesterday's fast food.

Cody didn't look at him. Didn't let himself.

Because when he did, something hot flickered in his chest. Not sadness. Something sharper. His hands wanted to curl into fists. His teeth pressed together until they ached. Some part of him, deep down where he kept the ugly things, wanted to grab one of those bottles and...

He killed it. Shoved it down where it couldn't breathe. Felt it settle somewhere behind his ribs, banked but not gone.

*Not today. Not ever.*

He stepped out, dodging boxes and piles of junk like he was playing a video game on expert mode. The place stank. That mix of wet basement, forgotten leftovers, and enough booze to make your eyes water. The kitchen counter was buried under dishes and takeout boxes stacked higher than a Jenga tower about to fall. He grabbed a breakfast bar from a torn-up box that looked like it had survived a flood, then fished out a water bottle that wasn't exactly cold from the sea of ketchup packets and coffee mugs with science experiments growing inside them. He headed for the door, his hand reaching for the knob like it was the finish line in a race he ran every morning.

Outside, it was freezing cold, like opening a freezer door right in your face. His crappy jacket might as well have been made of paper, and his jeans were so dirty they could practically stand up on their own. Every breath made a little cloud that disappeared in a blink. He walked to the bus stop with his hands stuffed in his pockets, watching the ground so he wouldn't trip on the busted-up sidewalk. The streetlights made that annoying buzzing sound, and half of them didn't even work right, making the street look like something out of a cheap horror movie. The bus stop sign was crooked, all beat-up looking, with a schedule you couldn't even read anymore because of all the rain.

Bus number 55 would haul him to community college. Just a bunch of ugly brick buildings where dreams went to die. He was the king of C-minus, doing just enough work not to fail, but never anything special. Some vague liberal arts degree that wouldn't get him anywhere. No real plans, just the same boring routine: get up, deal with the mess at home, ride the bus, sit through class. Rinse and repeat, until life threw another curveball his way. The bus showed up making that dying-dinosaur noise buses always make. Cody got on, swiped his pass at the little machine that never works right the first time, and found a spot in the back where nobody would bother him.

The bus was half-full. His brain did that thing it always did. Cataloged without permission. The woman in scrubs, third row, would get off at Mercy General. The kid with the backpack covered in anime pins was community college, same as him, but freshman based on the lanyard still around his neck. Nobody kept those past October. The old guy clutching the grocery bag would ride two more stops, then the senior center. The couple near the front were fighting about something, body language all wrong. Her arms crossed, his shoulders hunched forward. They wouldn't make it to Christmas.

He used to do this with defenses. Read the formation, predict the blitz, know where the hole would open before the ball was snapped. Captain of the team. The guy coaches trusted with the audibles. A lifetime ago. Now he just read bus passengers like it mattered.

Like anything mattered.

The doors shut with that snake-hiss sound, and the whole bus shook like it was cold. Cody pressed his head against the window, not because he was sad or happy or anything. He just liked how the buzzing traveled from the glass into his bones. Like one of those electric toothbrushes, but for his whole head. It reminded him he wasn't completely dead inside yet. He closed his eyes and everything turned into background noise, like when you're underwater in a swimming pool and can hear people talking but can't make out the words. His brain switched back on when the bus started slowing down like it was dragging its feet. Some garbled robot-voice shouted his stop, and he peeled his eyes open to see those ugly brick boxes they called a college staring back at him. He got up like a puppet with half its strings cut, swaying as the bus wheezed to a stop. Great. Another day of showing up just enough to not totally fail, but not enough to actually matter to anyone, including himself.

# Chapter 2: C-Minus

The professor droned on about something at the front of the room, voice flat as a dead battery. Some theory tied to some algorithm Cody already knew he'd never use. He copied a few lines from the board anyway, pen moving on autopilot, hand making shapes his brain didn't bother keeping. This was his life now. Same crap, different day, until it all blurred together.

He'd thought college might change things. New place. New faces. Maybe one moment that didn't feel like a rerun. But it turned out that without any direction, a new building was just a different wall to smack into. His life had always been like that. Every time something looked like it might finally be better, a brick wall went up and he'd hit it face-first. Same result every time.

His pen paused over the page as his brain drifted where it always drifted when he sat still too long. Back to that night. High school. State championships. The roar of the crowd, the white glare of stadium lights, the sharp smell of sweat and turf. One hard shove from the other player, one taunt that hit too close to home, and something in him snapped.

He remembered the heat of it. How fast it moved from his chest to his fists. How everything went red and quiet at the same time, like the world had narrowed down to just him and that kid's face. All the crap he'd been carrying around his whole life came pouring out through his fists. By the time coaches dragged him off, the other kid was on the ground and everyone looked at Cody like he was a monster.

The worst part wasn't the suspension. Wasn't losing his spot on the team or watching the scholarship talks dry up overnight. The worst part was how good it had felt. For about three seconds, before the horror kicked in, he'd felt more alive than he had in years.

That scared him more than anything.

Since then, the town had shut its doors. Old teammates stopped answering messages. Friends crossed the street when they saw him coming. Parents lowered their voices when he passed. Now he sat alone near the middle of a lecture hall, staring through notes he didn't care about. Half thinking of dropping this semester and disappearing somewhere else. But the notebook in front of him and the tuition tied to it were paid for with his own money. Nights and weekends at the burger place down the street, wiping grease off counters until morning. Same old routine. The only thing that still belonged to him.

Movement caught his eye. Third row, blue hoodie. The guy had been fidgeting the whole lecture, but now his hand dipped below the desk in a rhythm. Phone check. Glance at board. Phone check. Scribble. The reflection off his glasses showed the screen glow every time he looked down. Cody's pattern brain catalogued it without trying. The nervous bounce of the leg. The way he angled his body to block the girl next to him from seeing. The too-fast scribbling that didn't match the professor's pace. Cheating. Obvious if you knew what to look for.

*Not my problem.*

He went back to his notes.

Cody's phone buzzed against the desk. He glanced down, glad for the excuse to look away from the board. A text from his manager.

Can you cover tonight's shift

He didn't hesitate.

Sure. I got it.

Anything to keep him away from that apartment for a few more hours.

He slid the phone back into his pocket and forced his eyes to the front again. The professor was still going on about variables and equations, same flat voice from the start of class. The guy moved through the slides like a vending machine dispensing snacks. Push button, get lecture. No soul required. Cody watched him and saw another person who'd stopped trying a long time ago. Someone who just showed up, talked at a room of half-asleep students, collected a paycheck, and went home. Another life stuck in a rut.

"Make sure to read through the chapter on advanced equations before next class," the professor said at last.

Chairs scraped back. People started talking, some complaining, some already laughing about something else. Cody closed his notebook. He knew he'd forget most of what he'd written by tomorrow. He wasn't stupid. The information came easy enough when he tried. He just couldn't keep caring. Not when he couldn't see the point.

By lunchtime, he drifted into the campus main hall. The student lounge spread out under fluorescent lights that made everyone look a little sick. Scattered tables. Old couches sagging in the middle like they'd given up. Vending machines humming against the far wall. A TV in the corner mumbled the news, anchors talking about politics and weather in the same bored tone. Nearby, a cluster of students whispered and laughed about whatever students laugh about, voices going up and down. The air smelled like cheap pizza, burnt coffee, and reheated fries. Everything blended together into background noise. Another boring piece of a boring day. Cody found a table near the window and sat with his back to the wall. Old habit. He could see the whole room from here. His brain did its thing. The guy by the vending machine, hoodie up, shoulders hunched. Trying to decide if he could afford both a soda and chips. He'd go chips. More food for the money. The two girls on the couch were studying together, but one of them kept checking her phone and the other one had noticed. That friendship had maybe a month left. The kid at the next table over had his textbook open but hadn't turned a page in ten minutes. He was going to fail whatever test was coming.

Cody used to do this on the field. Read the defense before the snap. Know which linebacker was bluffing, which safety was going to bite on the fake. Patterns. People were just patterns if you watched long enough. Now he watched college kids pick at their lunches and wondered why he bothered. He poked at his food and scrolled through his phone, killing time until his next class.

---

On his way out of the lounge, he passed the lecture hall from this morning. A cluster of students stood outside, voices low but urgent. He recognized the girl who'd been sitting next to blue hoodie guy. She was crying.

"I didn't cheat," she kept saying. "I don't even have my phone. Check my bag. Check anything."

The professor stood with his arms crossed, unmoved. "The proctor saw suspicious activity in that area. You were the closest."

Blue hoodie was nowhere to be seen. Probably halfway across campus by now.

Cody should keep walking. This wasn't his fight. Getting involved never ended well for him.

His feet stopped anyway.

"It wasn't her."

Everyone turned. The professor raised an eyebrow. The girl blinked at him through wet lashes.

"Guy in the blue hoodie," Cody said. "Third row, two seats to her left. He had his phone under the desk the whole time. You could see the screen reflected in his glasses."

Silence. The professor's expression flickered. Doubt, then irritation.

"And you are?"

"Nobody." Cody shrugged. "But I was in that class. And I know what I saw."

The professor studied him for a long moment, then turned back to the girl. "We'll... look into it."

Cody didn't wait for thanks. He was already walking.

Behind him, he heard the girl's voice. "Thank you." Small. Surprised.

He didn't turn around.

By the time he got to the library that afternoon, he'd already gotten three dirty looks from people he didn't recognize. Blue hoodie's friends, probably. Word traveled fast in a small school.

*Do the right thing,* he thought. *Watch it blow up in your face. Same story, different day.*

---

Then something popped into his head. Clear as a bell.

*Study for midterms next week.*

He froze for a second. He had never planned on doing that. Cram the night before, maybe. Cheat off old notes online, sure. But actually study, days ahead? That wasn't him.

It didn't even feel like his own thought.

Cody set his phone down and stared at the table. He'd had random thoughts before. Everyone did. But this one sat different. Heavier. Like someone had dropped a rock in his skull and it was just sitting there, waiting.

*Study for midterms.*

He tried to shake it off. Went back to scrolling. But every few seconds, the thought pushed back. Insistent. Patient.

*Fine,* he thought. *You want to play this game? Let's see where it goes.*

It wasn't belief. It was curiosity. The same part of his brain that read defenses wanted to know what happened if he followed the weird impulse instead of ignoring it.

By the time his afternoon classes ended, the thought had dug in deep. He had a few hours before his shift at the burger place. Instead of killing time like usual, his feet carried him toward the library.

The campus library was big enough to hold everything the school offered, but small enough that no one ever got lost in it. It smelled like every library he'd ever been in. Paper and dust and something dry that stuck to the back of his throat. Rows of shelves lined up in neat aisles. A computer center near the entrance with old towers humming like a refrigerator on its last legs. A table of printers at the far wall spitting out papers for people who'd waited until the last minute. Cody checked his phone to see what he needed to review. As he scrolled through his notes app, the screen flickered. Went gray for a second, then snapped back.

A new line sat at the top of his notes.

*Study: The Harrowfield Incident, primary accounts and analysis.*

He blinked. He had never typed that. He'd never even heard of it. He scrolled up and down, checked the edit history, but everything looked normal. Like the line had always been there.

His pattern brain kicked in. This wasn't a glitch. Glitches didn't add complete sentences with proper punctuation. Glitches gave you gibberish or crashed the app. This was something else.

He should be freaked out. He should put the phone down and walk away and pretend this never happened.

Instead, he felt that same curiosity from before. The itch to see what happened next.

*Alright,* he thought. *Let's see what you've got.*

He walked to the front desk. The librarian on duty was a skinny nineteen-year-old with pale skin and tired eyes, a campus job lanyard hanging from their neck. Cody asked if they had anything on the Harrowfield Incident. Maybe a history text or some collection of accounts.

The librarian stared at him for a second, face blank, like the words had to travel a long way to reach them. Another zombie shuffling through the campus routine.

"I dunno," they said at last. "If we have something like that, it would be in the back corner. No one really goes there. You can check."

Cody held their gaze for a second. The kid already looked beat and he didn't feel like pushing. Not worth the effort. He gave a short nod, turned away from the desk, and headed into the library.

He passed the well-lit sections first, the shelves with colorful textbooks and new releases on display. Step by step, the lights got dimmer and the voices from the entrance faded out. By the time he reached the far corner that nobody used, the air felt heavier. Quieter. Cody turned down the narrow aisle, lined with tall shelves that looked dustier than everything else, and started looking. He ran a finger along the spines, squinting to make out the faded lettering. Cobwebs hung in the upper corners like nobody had cleaned back here in years. The air smelled stale. Dusty. Like the back of a closet that hadn't been opened since someone died.

*History of Regional Rail Systems.*
*Agricultural Policies, 1920 to 1945.*
*Collected Essays on Civic Reform.*

Nothing about Harrowfield. Nothing about any incident.

He scanned the section again, slower this time, then stood up straight with a sigh. Typical.

*Gotta do this the hard way, Guiles.*

The thought came with a dry edge he barely recognized as his own. He stepped back from the shelf, letting his eyes drift across the aisle to the next row, where the lights were even dimmer. Something pulled at him from that direction. Not a voice, but close.

Cody shifted his bag on his shoulder and moved toward the next shelf, ready to start over.

The same feeling shoved its way back into his head. Small, but heavy.

*Check again.*

It wasn't really words. More like a push that turned his shoulders before he decided to move. Cody sighed and stepped back to the shelf he'd already looked through. He let his eyes move from left to right, slower this time. Then he saw it.

*The Harrowfield Incident.*

The title sat there in dull gold letters on a dark spine, about halfway down.

His pattern brain flagged it immediately. He'd looked at this exact spot thirty seconds ago. The book hadn't been there. He was sure of it. He'd run his finger across those spines, read every title. This one would have jumped out.

But here it was. Like it had been waiting for him to pay attention.

Cody stood very still for a moment. The logical part of his brain, the part that had gotten him through eighteen years of a world that made sense, wanted to explain this away. Bad lighting. Tired eyes. He'd just missed it the first time.

The other part of his brain, the part that read patterns and predicted plays and knew when something was about to break open, that part said: *This is real. Pay attention.*

He pulled the book out. Heavier than he expected, cloth cover rough under his fingers, dust floating off the edges. He carried it to an empty desk near the window, dropped his bag on the chair next to him, and sat down. He took out his laptop, opened a blank document for notes, then flipped to the first chapter. The pages were yellow at the corners, print a little faded, but still readable. He started in.

A rural township, population listed, coordinates given. Dates. A stiff description of something that had happened in a place he'd never heard of. At first it read like every boring history book he'd ever cracked open. But the deeper he went, page after page, the more it started to get under his skin. The way the writer described the streets. The layout of the town. The way people went about their days.

Something in the back of his head stirred.

Cody frowned, leaned closer to the page, and turned to the next chapter.

And then, something happened.

---


# Chapter 3: A White Light

Cody turned the page. For a second his brain checked out, eyes sliding over the words without taking anything in. Then one word jumped out from the middle of the paragraph.

*Timberwood.*

His pulse kicked. The word wasn't bolded or anything, just regular print, but something in him reacted like someone had yelled it in his ear. Adrenaline hit him like a shot of espresso. His chest got tight, not painful, just this pressure that made it hard to breathe. The hairs on his arms stood up. His eyes went wide and for a second, just a second, something woke up inside him.

Hope.

Or wanting.

Some feeling so old and buried he couldn't even name it.

The word brought a flash with it. Not a memory he recognized, but a picture that popped behind his eyes like a camera flash. Tall, dark trees disappearing into morning fog. A two-lane road cutting between them. A green highway sign, just clear enough to read.

*Welcome to Timberwood.*

Then it was gone. The picture, the feeling, cut off like someone hit a switch.

Why that name? He didn't know anyone from Timberwood. He'd never been there, far as he knew. But the word stuck in his head like a fishhook.

He frowned, turned the page, and the world started going weird. Slow at first. The hum of computers got quieter, like someone was turning down the volume. The sound of feet on carpet faded out, like hearing things underwater. A thin ringing started in his ears, barely there. The colors around him started getting fuzzy. The desk, the shelves, even his own hands looked like they were losing their edges. His pattern brain kicked in, trying to make sense of it. Stroke? Seizure? Some kind of episode? He ran through the symptoms he knew. Vision changes. Hearing changes. Tingling. But this didn't feel medical. It felt like the world was coming apart at the seams. Then everything hit at once.

Every emotion he'd ever felt slammed together like cars in a pileup. Happy, sad, scared, pissed off, all of it mashed together into one big mess. His whole body locked up. Felt like his brain was trying to run ten programs at the same time and crashing hard. It all squeezed down into this tiny bright spot right in front of his eyes, like staring at a light bulb too long. He smelled something sharp and clean, like the air right after lightning hits.

White.

The words on the page disappeared. The ink just melted away, leaving blank paper. Then the paper was gone too. The page, the desk, the library, all of it wiped out like someone had taken an eraser to the whole world.

Part of him wanted to fight it. Dig in. Hold onto something, anything, that made sense.

But another part, the part that had been sitting on the edge of his bed every morning wondering why he bothered getting up, that part leaned into the pull.

*Anywhere but here.*

He stopped fighting.

For a second he couldn't tell if he was falling or floating. No up, no down, no sound. Just the name Timberwood echoing through all that white nothing.

Cody floated in empty white. Like being inside a blank piece of paper. No horizon, no shadows, just bright in every direction. His feet drifted down, slow and steady, until they hit something that felt like ground. He could feel pressure under his shoes, but when he looked down there was nothing there. No floor. Just more of that bleached-out white everywhere. The white started changing. First it just got fuzzy at the edges of his vision, like a TV going out of focus. Then it got thicker, shifting and warping faster, until it felt like the whole place was breathing around him. His eyes watered. Everything blurred. He squinted against the brightness. The air got heavy. Pressed down on his chest and shoulders like a weight. Each breath came harder than the one before. A thought crept in, small and scared. His heart pounded when it hit him.

*Am I dying?*

*Am I already dead?*

The second he thought it, the white answered.

It rushed at him from every direction, collapsing inward. In one silent second, all of it slammed into his chest. He felt it go through his ribs and into his lungs, a blast of cold that knocked the air right out of him.

Everything went black.

No light. No up or down. No floor. No feeling in his hands. Just thick, perfect nothing, like someone had switched off the whole idea of space.

---


# Chapter 4: Welcome to Timberwood

Black. Nothing but black. The kind of dark where you can't tell if your eyes are open or shut.

Then a feeling. Fuzzy at first, like waking up after passing out. Something solid under him. His fingers twitched and touched something soft. Grass. Blades bending under his hand, tickling his skin. His palm hit something rougher. Thin, sharp little things.

Pine needles.

*What the hell am I touching?*

That thought helped. Gave him something to grab onto. He moved his fingers again and felt more of those little sharp bits. Pine needles everywhere. Like someone had dumped a Christmas tree on him.

Then a smell. Weak at first, like his nose was stuffed with cotton. Pine, barely there. It got stronger bit by bit, the way your nose clears when a cold finally lets up. That moment when you blow your nose and can actually smell again. Then it rushed in all at once.

Pine sap and fresh grass. Mixed together into something obvious.

*Woods. I'm in the woods.*

Sound came next.

At first just muffled garbage in his ears, like water stuck in there after swimming. Then it started clearing up. The noise broke apart into pieces.

Voices.

A few of them. Low, scattered. Words he couldn't make out. One sounded like a gasp. Another like a short laugh. Chatter mixing with bird calls from somewhere up in trees he couldn't see yet.

Then one voice cut through. Deeper. Rough.

"Alright everyone, step back, nothing to see here."

Clear. Close. The kind of voice that expected people to do what it said. Cody pulled in one more breath that tasted like pine and cold air.

Then he opened his eyes.

Blurry. Everything blurry.

Light and color smeared together above him, but he could make out trees. Tall pines reaching up, branches weaving together into a dark ceiling. Light came through in streaks, dust floating around in it.

Something moved between him and that light.

A dark shape leaned over him, blocking the brightness. His eyes tried to focus but couldn't get there. All he saw was a big silhouette, shoulders wide enough to block half the sky.

Then he found the eyes.

Not human. Two amber points, like someone had switched on a pair of gold headlights behind that dark face. His vision snapped into focus around them.

Dark fur framing that stare. Almost black but silver at the edges where the light caught it. A muzzle, long and solid. Ears pointed forward. The shape became a face he'd only ever seen in movies or nature documentaries. A wolf. But standing upright. Alert. Thinking.

A big paw reached toward him. No. A hand. Padded, tipped with claws, covered in dark gray fur.

Cody jerked back before he knew what he was doing, heart hammering against his ribs like it wanted out. Pine needles stabbed into his palms as he scrambled backward, breathing way too fast.

Someone behind the wolf gasped. Others muttered. As his eyes adjusted, the rest of the scene came into focus.

They were all staring at him.

His brain kicked into gear. Same thing it did on the bus, in the student lounge, on the field. Reading the room. Finding the threats. A tall giraffe stood farther back, long neck bent down, spots disappearing into a campus jacket. Body language said scared. She kept her distance, weight shifting like she was ready to bolt. Not a threat. Near her feet, a little mongoose hung onto a backpack strap, whiskers going crazy. Curious, not aggressive. Leaning forward, not back. Also not a threat. Some gazelles huddled together, ears flicking, eyes huge. Herd behavior. They'd run before they'd fight.

The badgers were different. A bunch of them, built like linebackers even just standing there. Arms crossed, weight forward. That was challenge posture. They were deciding whether he was prey.

*Those are the ones to watch.*

A couple more wolves behind the big one, younger, skinnier, wearing team shirts and sweats. Following the leader. They'd do whatever he did.

And in front of them all, the one who'd reached for him.

Up close, he was huge. Built like a refrigerator wearing a dark Timberwood Badgers jersey and jacket. Dark gray fur, thick around the neck and shoulders, silver streaks under his eyes and across his chest. Those amber eyes locked onto Cody. Steady. Not mean, but the kind of intense that made you want to look away. Too real.

But his paw was open, not fisted. His ears were forward, attentive, not flattened back in aggression. His body was positioned between Cody and the crowd. Not cornering him. Shielding him.

*He's not hunting. He's protecting.*

The realization cut through some of the panic.

The smell hit him full force now. Pine, trampled grass, something clean and warm underneath. Like a locker room after everyone's showered, but outside.

His mouth moved before his brain caught up.

"Stay back. Do not come closer!" Cody yelled, voice cracking through the trees louder than anything he'd said in years.

The yell hung there.

The big wolf didn't flinch. Didn't even blink.

He straightened up a little, ears tipping forward, paws held out where Cody could see them. When he talked, his voice was low and steady. Same gravel as before.

"Easy," he said. "I'm not going to touch you."

Cody sucked in a rough breath. His eyes bounced around the circle. The giraffe. The mongoose. The gazelles. The badgers. More wolves. All of them standing on two legs, wearing clothes, looking at him with the same mix of curiosity and nerves he felt in his own gut.

"What the hell," Cody whispered. Then louder. "You're talking. You're all talking. How is that even possible?"

A few students backed up. Someone muttered something about humans. Another voice said, "I told you it was a human."

The big wolf glanced over his shoulder at them, then back at Cody. One ear twitched.

"Yeah," he said. "I'm talking. Welcome to Timberwood Hollow, where the animals walk upright and the humans are the weird ones."

If that was a joke, his voice didn't show it. He stayed crouched, eyes level with Cody's. One paw still out, claws tucked.

"You're freaking out the locals almost as much as they're freaking you out," he added. "Keep shouting and security will decide you're a problem instead of someone who needs help."

Cody looked at the paw, then at the crowd behind it. His breathing was ragged, but he made himself talk.

"Am I the only human here?"

The wolf made a sound that might've been a laugh.

"You're the only one on the ground," he said. "You're not the first we've ever seen. Just the first I've seen in years."

He looked past Cody. Campus security was pushing through the crowd, radio crackling.

"Crowd's getting bigger and they're already jumpy," the wolf said. "Can you sit up? Can you walk?"

Cody ran the options. Stay here, get swarmed by security, end up in some kind of holding cell while they figured out what to do with him. Or go with the giant wolf who hadn't made a single aggressive move, whose body language said protector, whose voice said I've got this handled.

His pattern brain had already made the call. The wolf was the safest bet in this crowd.

He pushed himself up. Legs felt like jelly. The wolf moved closer, slow enough that Cody could track every inch.

"What am I supposed to do?" Cody muttered. "I move, they stare. I stay here, they stare more."

"First," the wolf said. "Breathe."

Cody dragged air into his lungs. Pine and dirt and that weird warm smell coming off the wolf.

"Second," the wolf went on, "we walk. Nice and calm. My dorm's close. Quiet. Private. You can ask questions there without half the freshman class filming you for their group chats."

He glanced toward the trees.

"Third, you tell me what you remember. Library, white light, whatever happened. Might help us figure out how to get you home."

"Home," Cody repeated. The word felt thin. Like it didn't mean much anymore. "Okay. Sure. But what about this crowd?"

The wolf stood up to his full height, turning so his body blocked Cody from the students. From down on the ground, Cody got a real look at how big he was. Shoulders that could fill a doorway. Jersey stretched tight over a chest built from years of hitting people for sport. When he spoke, his voice carried without him needing to yell.

"Alright," he said, sweeping his gaze around. "Show's over. Campus security has this. Get back to class before your professors start counting heads."

The crowd shifted. Some students hesitated, but security seemed happy to let the wolf run things. One of the officers, a stocky badger with a badge clipped to his belt, caught the wolf's eye. The wolf gave him a tiny nod. *I got this.*

The officer relaxed and turned away, waving a couple gawkers down the path.

But Cody's pattern brain caught something else. A second officer, a lean coyote, stood at the edge of the clearing with a radio to his muzzle. Not managing the crowd. Reporting. His eyes stayed on Cody the whole time he talked.

On a building past the trees, a security camera sat mounted under the eaves. Red light blinking.

The crowd broke up. People started talking again, quieter. They drifted back toward the main paths. A few kept glancing back, but nobody came closer. The wolf looked down at Cody.

"Walk beside me," he said, quiet. "Don't look back."

He held out his paw again.

Cody had made his choice the moment he'd read the wolf's body language. Protector, not predator. He grabbed the paw. The pads were rough but warm, the grip careful. The wolf pulled him up like he weighed nothing.

For a second, the wolf's ear twitched. His eyes flicked to where their hands met, then back to Cody's face. Something crossed his expression. Curiosity, maybe. But he didn't say anything.

They walked out of the circle together. The wolf kept an easy pace down a narrow path between the pines, away from the main trail. His tail hung low and relaxed, his big body blocking most of the stares. Cody glanced back once. The coyote officer was still there. Watching which path they took. After a few seconds, the wolf spoke.

"My name is Lukas," he said. "What's yours?"

"Cody," he answered. Voice still shaky. "Cody Guiles."

Lukas nodded once, like he was filing it away.

"Alright, Cody," he said. "Dorms are just past those oaks, third building on the left. We get you inside, you sit down, and then we figure out what the hell happened."

They kept walking. The sounds from the clearing faded behind them. The smell of pine and grass followed them out of the woods.

# Chapter 5: Borrowed Space

The late October air cut through Cody's thin jacket as they stepped onto the main path. Gray sky hung low, the kind that looked like it might rain but probably wouldn't. Wind sent leaves skittering across the brick walkway. The trees lining the quad had gone bare, branches sticking up like dead fingers, though a few stubborn oaks still held onto their brown leaves like they hadn't gotten the memo.

Lukas cut across the quad instead of taking the main paths, heading toward a line of old oaks and a narrower walkway. The big wolf moved at an easy pace, but Cody noticed how he kept himself between Cody and everyone else. A walking wall of fur and muscle in a green and black team jacket.

"So," Lukas asked, eyes forward, "what's the last thing you remember? Before you woke up in our woods."

Cody reached for the strap of his backpack, then remembered it was gone. Right. Library, then nothing. His shoulder felt wrong without it.

"I was in my college library," he said. His voice sounded too loud in the open air. "Studying for midterms. I blinked, everything went white, and then I was on the ground with a bunch of... people staring at me."

Anthro people. Wolves, foxes, something that had definitely been a raccoon in a hoodie. All standing up, all watching him like he was the weird one.

"You get used to the staring," Lukas said. His ear flicked, catching some sound behind them Cody couldn't hear. "White out and a hard landing. That tracks with the stories."

"Stories?" Cody stumbled on the word. "You're telling me this has happened before?"

"Not every week." Lukas gave him a sidelong glance, amber eyes calm. "But you're not the first human to show up somewhere you didn't mean to be. Just the first I've seen in person."

That should have helped. It didn't. If this was a known thing, then how many other people had gone missing from quiet corners of their lives and never made it back?

He shoved the thought down. *One thing at a time, Guiles.*

They passed under the oaks, and the temperature dropped in the shade. Dead leaves crunched under their feet, and the air smelled like rotting leaves and wet dirt. A breeze pushed Lukas's scent toward him again: pine, grass, something clean that might have been soap. Weirdly calming, like a locker room after a game. Sweat and detergent and routine. The campus spread out around them as they walked. Old stone buildings with ivy on the walls stood next to newer glass and steel ones. A clock tower stuck up in the distance, face just visible above the trees. Ahead, clusters of students crossed the main walks. All fur and feathers and shiny scales, their voices a low hum. Their breath made little clouds in the cold as they laughed and called to each other, bundled up in jackets and scarves.

Lukas changed their route again, picking a narrow sidewalk that went around a dorm instead of through the busy paths. Cody noticed it this time. The way the wolf's eyes checked every group they might have to pass. The way his shoulders tensed whenever someone looked too long.

At one point, Lukas steered them under an awning, then around a corner, avoiding a stretch of walkway that looked perfectly fine to Cody. He glanced back. A camera mounted on the building they'd just passed. Pointed right where they would have walked.

*Huh.*

"Your dorm is really out of the way, huh," Cody said, trying for dry and almost getting there.

"Not really." Lukas's tone stayed flat. "I just like the scenic route." Scenic route, sure. Scenic and conveniently empty.

Lukas's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, glanced at the screen. His ears flattened for a moment before resetting. He read it for a second, then pocketed it without responding. Cody waited for an explanation. None came.

"Look," Cody muttered, "if walking with me is going to get you in trouble or something, you don't have to babysit. I can just, I don't know, hide in the trees until this blows over."

Lukas snorted. "You're not hiding in the trees." His tail flicked once. "You landed on a campus, not in a lab. You're a person, Cody, not an exhibit. I'm not letting anyone turn this into a project."

The word *lab* hooked into him. He almost tripped.

"I didn't say anything about a lab," Cody said, keeping his voice level.

"You didn't have to." Lukas's ears pressed back for a second, then relaxed. "You're jumpy, you don't know the rules here, and people in charge like to turn problems into paperwork. My job is to make sure you don't end up in anyone's file folder before you've had breakfast."

People in charge. Paperwork. Cody followed Lukas's glance and saw a tall brick building with wide glass doors and a metal sculpture of a double helix out front. It sat there against the gray sky like a threat, windows reflecting bare branches. A science building. Of course. He swallowed. "So your... dean, or whatever you have, they'd freak out about me?"

"Dean would want meetings," Lukas said carefully. "Committees. Words like *unprecedented* and *opportunity.*" His muzzle flattened on that last one. "You don't need any of that today. Today you need coffee and somewhere you can sit without an audience."

Lukas didn't dress it up or make promises. He simply refused to let it happen.

They rounded a corner and the dorm came into view. Five stories of old brick, older than some of the other buildings on campus. Narrow windows, the kind of ugly that said function over form. A row of evergreen bushes lined the foundation, half-hiding a side entrance. Somewhere above, a window was cracked open despite the cold, music drifting down too quiet to make out.

Lukas swiped a keycard, pushed the door open, and checked the hall before waving Cody in.

The sound changed first. Outside noise dropped to the quiet of old carpet and distant doors closing. The place smelled like dust, cleaner, and a mix of fur and laundry soap. Normal enough, if you didn't look too close at the bulletin board, where every smiling face on the flyers had some kind of muzzle.

Cody's heart rate finally started slowing down.

"Third floor," Lukas said. "No elevator, sorry." He pointed to an out-of-order sign on the elevator doors.

"Fine," Cody said. "I have legs."

He kept his eyes on his boots as they climbed, trying not to notice the four or five students who went quiet as he passed. He felt their stares anyway, prickling along his arms. Lukas blocked most of it, a solid wall on the outside of the stairs, making it hard for anyone to stop Cody or get a good look.

They reached a door with a beat-up Timberwood Badgers sticker stuck crooked near the handle. Lukas unlocked it and pushed it open.

The place was small but it worked. Open room that doubled as kitchen and living area. A counter ran along the left wall near the door, small sink at one end, dorm fridge underneath. Coffee maker sat on the counter next to a portable cooktop and microwave. Past that, the room opened into a living area: fold-out couch facing a TV on the opposite wall, maybe fifty inches, with an entertainment center underneath holding a couple gaming consoles. Desk to the left of the TV, gaming rig glowing on its surface, fan humming. Sturdy coffee table in the middle. Two doors at the far end of the right wall. Through the one that was half-open, Cody caught a glimpse of a bed, a shelf full of trophies, and a football on a stand. The bedroom. Down the hall came a burst of laughter, then a door slamming.

"Come in," Lukas said. "Door locks. No one barges in here but me."

*Safe.* The word bounced around Cody's head, looking for somewhere to stick.

He stepped inside. The carpet felt rough under his sneakers. He noticed the dirt on his jeans, the leaf bits stuck to his jacket from the forest floor. The thing was barely holding together anymore, threads coming loose at the cuffs, but it was all he had. A team jacket hung from a hook by the door. Jerseys were pinned to the wall above the couch. The whole place smelled like coffee grounds and something warm. The kind of smell that said someone actually lived here. He caught his reflection in the dark TV screen. Human face, too pale. Dark hair messed up and pushed back with his fingers. Eyes wide and shadowed from a semester of crappy sleep. He didn't belong here. He didn't really belong anywhere, but here he stuck out like a sore thumb.

"Sit," Lukas said. He pointed at the fold-out couch. "I'll make coffee."

The couch springs complained when Cody dropped onto it. A window on the far wall looked out over a slice of campus. Brick buildings, trees, a path where students laughed at something he couldn't hear. His pattern brain tried to read them through the glass. Tails and ears moved as they talked, adding layers to the body language he was used to. Posture still worked. The way someone leaned in or held back, the angle of their shoulders. That translated. But the ear positions, the tail movements, those were new variables. A fox's ears flattened as she talked to a friend. Fear? Annoyance? Submission? He couldn't tell yet.

*You'll figure it out,* he told himself. *You always do.*

He pressed his hands together between his knees until his knuckles hurt.

Behind him, Lukas moved like he'd done this a thousand times. Scoop grounds, fill water, flip a switch. The machine sputtered and hissed, filling the room with the smell of brewing coffee. Normal. Grounding. For a second, if Cody closed his eyes, he could almost pretend he was back at the community college café, nursing a too-bitter cup between classes and pretending that counted as having a future. Except he'd never had a six-and-a-half-foot wolf a few feet away, talking quiet so he wouldn't fall apart.

"You said coffee exists here," Cody heard himself say. "Phones, too."

"Coffee, phones, bills, exams," Lukas said. "Congratulations, you crossed dimensions and still landed somewhere that assigns homework. Sugar?"

"Black is fine."

Lukas brought over a chipped Timberwood Badgers mug and put it in his hands. The heat hit his fingers first, then his wrists, chasing out the cold from the woods. He took a sip. Strong and a little bitter, but real. Warmth went down his throat and loosened the tight knot in his chest, just a little.

Lukas opened the mini-fridge and pulled out a foil-covered container. "Noodles," he said, peeling back the lid. Steam curled up, carrying ginger and soy. "They're safe. Should be, anyway."

Cody's stomach growled before he could stop it. He hadn't eaten since... he couldn't remember. The library? That felt like a different lifetime.

Lukas handed him a fork and slid the container across the coffee table. "Eat. You look like you're running on fumes."

Cody didn't argue. He scooped up a forkful, blew on it once, and shoved it in his mouth.

The first second was fine. Ginger, soy, a little sesame. Normal.

Then his sinuses caught fire.

"What the..." He choked, eyes watering, tongue screaming. Heat exploded across his mouth and down his throat like he'd swallowed a lit match. He grabbed for the coffee, took a gulp, and made it worse. "Oh god, oh fuck..."

Lukas's ears flattened. "Shit." He was already moving, yanking the fridge open again. A carton of milk hit the coffee table. "Drink. Now."

Cody grabbed it with shaking hands and chugged. The cold cut through some of the burn, but his lips still felt like they were melting. He gasped, wiped his streaming eyes, and stared at the noodles like they'd personally betrayed him.

"What the hell was that?"

Lukas picked up the container and sniffed. His muzzle wrinkled. "Benji." He said the name like a curse. "Habanero mash. He sneaks it into stuff when nobody's looking." He set the container down, shaking his head. "Those were supposed to be mine. Little bastard."

Cody took another long drink of milk, breathing through his nose. The fire was fading to a dull roar. "Who's Benji?"

"Hedgehog. Lives down the hall. Thinks he's funny." Lukas slid the poisoned noodles away from Cody like they might bite again. "He and Thorne, big bear on the team with me, they're floormates. Benji's good people, but his idea of a joke is chemical warfare."

Cody's tongue felt like sandpaper. "Remind me to thank him later."

"I'll let him know his prank landed on the interdimensional visitor instead of me." Lukas almost smiled. "He'll either be horrified or proud. Fifty-fifty."

Cody finished the milk and set the carton down, still breathing a little hard. His mouth would probably taste like burning for the next hour. Great first impression on his new reality.

"You didn't cause a scene, by the way," Lukas said, leaning against the counter. "Not any more than a dragon sighting would. People talk, then they move on."

"Pretty sure being the human who popped out of nowhere isn't something this place is going to forget overnight," Cody muttered.

"By lunch, the version where you breathed fire will be more popular than the truth." Lukas shrugged. "Rumors are loud, but they're not organized. What matters is who writes reports."

Cody looked up. "Reports."

"Dean. Department heads." Lukas's eyes flicked briefly toward the window, toward that science building, then back. "If they hear about you the wrong way, they'll want meetings and scans and big words. So I'd rather they hear nothing for a while."

There it was again. That same steady refusal, without the drama or horror stories.

"And you can stop that?" Cody asked.

"I can make it harder for them." Lukas folded his arms loosely. "Keep you off main routes, tell anyone who asks that you're a visiting student from out of town until we have a better plan. It buys time."

Cody studied him. His pattern brain was working again, cataloging details. The wolf's shoulders were still relaxed, but there was something tight around his eyes he hadn't noticed outside. The way his ears kept twitching toward the door, toward sounds in the hall. The slight tension in his jaw when he mentioned the dean. He was worried. Not about Cody. About what helping Cody might cost him. He realized this wasn't nothing for Lukas. Helping some random human who fell out of nowhere. Lying to whoever ran this place. Picking side paths and side doors and watching buildings with double helix sculptures. The guy was sticking his neck out, and Cody could see the weight of it now, sitting on those big shoulders like a bag of rocks.

"Why?" Cody asked. The word came out before he could stop it. "Why help me? You don't know me. I could be anybody."

Lukas was quiet for a second. His tail moved once, a slow sweep.

"Because you needed help," he said. "And I was there."

Cody waited for more. A tragic backstory, a complicated motive, something that explained why a stranger would stick his neck out. But that was it. That was the whole answer.

He didn't know what to do with that.

Cody felt how tired he was before he admitted it to himself. Coffee had taken the edge off the panic, but once the adrenaline faded, everything underneath was just exhausted. Bone tired. Waiting-at-the-bus-stop-at-dawn tired. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose. "So what now?" he asked. "Do we just... wait until tomorrow and see if the universe spits me back out?"

Lukas's ears tilted a little, like he was thinking through answers and throwing most of them out. "Tomorrow is a problem for tomorrow," he said. "Right now you need sleep."

"Sleep," Cody echoed. "In the magical furry universe where I maybe don't exist on paper."

"Paper can wait." Lukas glanced at the dark window, then back at Cody. "You look like you've been running on coffee and stubbornness for days already. Portal didn't help."

That was way too accurate.

Cody looked around the room. One bed, clearly taken. Desk, couch. No spare mattress appeared just because he needed one.

"Sounds like a plan," he said after a second. "Where am I sleeping?"

"Couch folds out," Lukas said. He nudged the ottoman with his paw and the top shifted, hinges clicking. "Sheets are inside. Blanket's clean, I promise." He nodded toward the two doors on the right wall. "Half bath on the left if you need it. Bedroom's on the right. Communal showers are down the hall if you want a real rinse, but that can wait till morning."

Cody pushed himself up from the couch. His legs felt like wet noodles. "Wake you if the walls start breathing, got it."

"Wake me if that happens for real," Lukas said. Something in his face softened. "Or if you need anything else."

Cody paused. "Walls breathe here?"

Lukas kept a straight face. "Only after my friend Benji's ramen. Otherwise they behave."

A tired laugh came out before Cody could stop it. Thinner than he wanted, but real.

Lukas clicked off the small kitchen light, leaving just the desk lamp and the dim light from the window. The room got smaller in a way that wasn't bad. Less space to get lost in.

"Get the bed set up," Lukas said. "I'm gonna hit the showers down the hall. I'll keep my door cracked when I get back. Holler if the furniture gets chatty."

Cody opened the ottoman. A folded sheet and a mismatched pillow sat inside, smelling like laundry soap and dust. He wrestled the couch into its new shape. The metal frame unfolded with the same complaint fold-out couches always make. Turns out interdimensional travel didn't improve couch design. He stripped off his jacket and draped it over the arm, then kicked off his shoes and socks. Cold air bit at his bare feet. Without his layers, he felt smaller. More like a kid crashing at a friend's place after missing the last bus. The pipes ticked in the walls. From down the hall, the faint hiss of water. Normal sounds.

He made the bed as best he could, corners more of a suggestion than anything, then sat down to test the mattress. Thin, but softer than his own at home, which had a permanent dip where his body had given up years ago.

The main door clicked open. Lukas walked in with a towel over his shoulder, fur a little damp. He wore shorts and a soft T-shirt now, smelling like soap, clean and sharp under the usual pine. He crossed to the bedroom door and pushed it open, then turned back.

He looked over Cody's handiwork on the fold-out. "It'll hold," he decided. "If it doesn't, you've got bigger problems than the dean."

Cody huffed. "Comforting."

"It's meant to be." Lukas's mouth twitched. He tipped his head toward the light switch. "I'm killing the lamp. You good?"

Cody nodded, then realized the wolf could probably see better in the dark than he could. "Yeah. I'm fine."

The lamp snapped off. For a second, Cody couldn't see anything. Then shapes came back: the rectangle of the window, the glow of the TV's standby light, Lukas's silhouette crossing toward the bedroom. The door pulled mostly closed, leaving just a crack of darkness. From past that crack, springs creaked as the wolf lay down. The room was quiet. Just the mini-fridge cycling, wind against the glass, distant door latches from somewhere else on the floor. No TV blaring, no sports channel filling the silence. No heavy, uneven snoring from behind a bedroom door, thick with bourbon and wasted time.

"Hey, uh," Cody said into the dark. His voice sounded smaller without anything to bounce off but the ceiling. "Lukas?"

Something moved in the bedroom. An ear probably perked up, though Cody couldn't see through the crack.

"Yeah?"

"Thanks." The word felt clumsy, too light for everything wrapped around it: the coffee, the shield in the crowd, the fact that nobody here had told him he was being dramatic or ungrateful. "For all of this."

A small pause. Cody could almost hear the wolf breathing.

"Anytime," Lukas said. No bravado, no joke on top.

Just that.

Past the cracked bedroom door, the mattress creaked. Blanket shifted. Then nothing. Cody lay back and stared at a ceiling he could barely see. He could make out shapes in the dark: the TV, the desk with its sleeping computer, the little green power light on the entertainment center. He let his mind wander because trying to pin it down never worked.

Could he just... live here? The thought showed up uninvited. This place had cell service and coffee makers and annoying friends with weaponized ramen. People threw around words like *dean* and *biology department*, and that should've scared him more, but it sat weird next to the image of his dad half-slid off the recliner, bourbon bottles on the carpet like they'd lost a fight.

Back there he was the kid from the wrong end of town with a bad incident in his past and a GPA that didn't impress anyone. A liberal arts major with a bus pass and a degree he could already feel sagging in his hands. Home was mildew and trash bags and stale booze, and the sound of his father cursing at late-night reruns.

Here he was the Human. Capital H. Everyone stared, but at least they saw him.

And Lukas. Patient, solid Lukas, who moved like a starting linebacker and watched people like they were plays on a field. Cody could admit, just to himself, that the wolf was stupidly good-looking: black fur, those amber eyes, that scent that meant woods and cool air and something steady underneath. The kind of guy who probably had everyone on campus orbiting him without even trying.

*Whole different planet, Guiles. Literally.*

His brain did that thing where it runs in circles until it gets tired of itself. Thoughts got blurry, words stopped making sense. The day's weight pushed him deeper into the thin mattress. Every muscle that had been braced for the next bad thing since he woke up in the woods finally started to let go. His breathing slowed down. Somewhere on the other side of the room, springs creaked once as Lukas shifted, then went quiet. Cody's eyes closed. Last thing he thought before he passed out: for the first time in forever, if he yelled in the dark, somebody might actually give a damn.

# Chapter 6: The Fox in the Lab

An alarm went off somewhere down the hall.

Cody opened his eyes to ceiling tiles he didn't recognize, dull morning light coming through a window he didn't remember falling asleep next to. For a long, foggy moment he had no idea where he was. Then it came back in pieces: furry world, talking animals, humans rare, giant wolf who smelled like pine and talked like someone used to keeping people calm. Right. Still here. He stretched on the couch, joints stiff from a night on springs that had seen better days. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes with the heels of his hands, trying to drag himself back to something close to awake.

The alarm cut off. The bedroom door creaked open and Lukas walked out, fur messed up from sleep, athletic shorts hanging low on his hips. He scratched at his ribs with one paw, eyes half-closed, moving with the loose shuffle of someone who woke up early out of habit, not choice.

"Morning." Lukas glanced at the folded blanket on the couch cushion, gave a small nod like he approved. "Couch didn't bite?"

Cody turned toward the voice and his body reacted before his brain caught up. He rolled back toward the far side of the couch, heart kicking against his ribs. The massive wolf shape in the dim morning light tripped every alarm he had.

Then memory caught up. The forest. The crowd. The dorm. The coffee.

"Shit, Lukas." Cody let out a breath and pressed a hand to his chest. "You scared me for a second. Still getting used to the whole culture shock thing. Sorry."

"No blood, no foul." Lukas yawned, fangs catching the window light. "Takes longer than twelve hours to swap universes without freaking out." He moved toward the kitchenette, nudging the coffee pot toward Cody. "Pour, breathe, pretend this is normal. By lunch you'll be catalogued and maybe halfway home."

Cody grabbed the pot and filled a mug, the bitter smell cutting through the fog in his head. Home. The word landed in his chest and just sat there, heavy and confusing.

"Yeah," he said, dragging the word out longer than he meant to. "Home. Sure."

Lukas caught the hesitation. His ears tilted back a little, but his face stayed neutral. He filled his own mug, steam rising off it.

"Or stay," Lukas said. "Choice isn't a slam dunk either way." He took a slow sip. "Library first. After that, you pick the lane."

Cody stared into the black coffee. The guy looking back at him in the reflection was tired and confused. Same face that had spent too many years just going through the motions.

"I don't know, man." He shook his head. "I don't want someone digging through ancient books on my account. Makes me feel like a jerk." He glanced up at Lukas, trying to read him. "I mean, it's not like portals to alternate realities just pop up out of nowhere. Or is that normal here?"

Lukas's face stayed flat, but one ear twitched. "Portals aren't Tuesday errands," he said. "But Timberwood keeps a shelf for the weird stuff. Meteor squirrels, haunted vending machines. You're just this month's footnote." He slid the sugar closer. "Drink. If the books come up empty, we'll figure it out without the guilt trip."

Cody waved off the sugar. "Thanks, but I take my coffee black in the morning. Hits harder that way."

Lukas raised an eyebrow, looking almost impressed. "Most freshmen drown it in syrup." He leaned against the counter, drinking his own black coffee. "Finish quick. Gem texts like she's charging by the letter."

Cody drained the mug in a few long gulps. The caffeine hit his blood like flipping a switch, sharpening his thoughts, dragging his brain back to something that actually worked. He set the empty mug on the counter and rolled his shoulders.

"Alright," he said. "I'm ready."

Lukas rinsed his cup and put it in the sink. "Library's across the quad. Stick close, keep your head down. People still rubberneck." He grabbed his keys, his phone, and a half-eaten protein bar from the counter. "Save your questions for Gem. She likes being the center of attention."

"Noted. Lead the way."

Lukas pushed the door open. Morning air hit Cody's face, cold and sharp, the bite of late October. The sky hung low and gray, threatening rain but probably bluffing. Wind cut through his thin jacket like it wasn't even there. He shoved his hands in his pockets and wished, not for the first time, that he'd landed in this world with something warmer. The quad stretched out in front of them, lawns brown and dead, brick paths dark from overnight moisture. Oak trees lined the edges, branches mostly bare, though a few stubborn leaves still hung on in shades of rust and brown. The ones that had fallen covered the grass in soggy patches, and every few seconds the wind sent a handful skittering across the walkway like they were late for something. A few early joggers moved along distant paths, breath making little clouds. Lukas positioned himself between them and Cody without being obvious about it, pace easy but purposeful.

"Path cuts behind the science block," Lukas said, voice low. "Fewer gawkers."

Cody's eyes kept wanting to wander. Everything about this place pulled at him: buildings that mixed organic curves with familiar brick and glass, statues of animals in scholarly robes, lampposts that curved like they were reaching for something. His pattern brain was already working, cataloging details whether he wanted it to or not. The way the architecture blended old and new. The paths that radiated out from central hubs. The sight lines that let you see who was coming from multiple directions. Someone had designed this place to feel open but watchable. Safe but surveilled. He wanted to stop and look, to figure out how a place like this could exist. But Lukas was taking back routes for a reason. Cody still remembered all those staring faces in the clearing.

"Right," he said. "No need to draw attention. Got it."

"Eyes forward, ears open," Lukas murmured as they passed a hedgehog on a bicycle. The hedgehog glanced their way, did a double-take, then pedaled on without stopping. "You'll get the tour after we know you won't disappear mid-sentence."

Cody almost smiled. "Sorry. Explorer Cody's on hold. Noted."

Lukas made a sound that might've been a laugh. "Explorer Cody can have his turn once the liability drops."

They cut behind the chemistry building, Lukas's boots scraping against wet brick. A squirrel in a lab coat almost ran into them coming around a corner, apologized in a distracted voice, then froze when it saw Cody. Eyes went wide. Whiskers twitched.

Lukas steered him forward before the moment could drag out. "Almost there."

Cody glanced back. The squirrel had his phone out. Typing something. Not moving.

*Filing that away.*

The library announced itself before they reached it.

It sat at the end of a narrow path, a hulking pile of gray stone and old brick that looked older than everything else on campus. Three stories of gothic architecture, all pointed arches and narrow windows, with a clock tower sticking up from one corner like a raised fist.

Dead ivy crawled up the east side in a tangle of brown and rust, still clinging even though it was dead, waiting for spring to bring it back. Gargoyles crouched at the corners of the roof, faces worn smooth by decades of weather. A pair of stone badgers flanked the main entrance, sitting on their haunches with books open in their laps, carved eyes watching everyone who walked by.

The words HOLLOWELL HALL were carved into the stone above the main doors, letters dark with age.

Near the entrance, a campus security officer stood with his arms crossed. Stocky. Badge on belt. Badger.

The same one from the clearing yesterday.

Cody's pattern brain flagged it immediately. *Routine patrol? Or following?*

Lukas didn't break stride, but his route shifted. Side door instead of main entrance. Didn't even glance at the officer.

*He noticed too.*

Cody ducked his head, hunched his shoulders. The last thing he wanted was to become a problem for the only person in this world who'd been decent to him. If Gem couldn't find a portal, if there was no way back, Lukas would probably kick him out. And then what? Wander around a town full of talking animals until someone decided he was a problem worth solving?

Lukas glanced back. His eyes caught the hunch of Cody's shoulders, the way he'd folded in on himself.

"Hey." His voice was low and steady. "You're not cargo." He slowed down just enough to walk beside Cody instead of ahead of him. "If Gem comes up empty, we figure something else out. Dorm's still yours until you say otherwise."

Some of the tension in Cody's chest let go. Not all of it, but enough.

"Your bullshit detector is scarily accurate, bro," he muttered.

"Thanks." Lukas shrugged, ears flicking. "Years of reading blitzes."

Lukas steered them away from the main entrance, toward a side door half-hidden behind some evergreen bushes. Gothic arch in weathered stone, iron ring handle dark with age. He grabbed it and pulled. Cool air came out, carrying the smell of old paper and dust, that library quiet.

"Gem's waiting on the main floor," Lukas said. "Then we head down to Special Collections. Try not to stare."

The street noise cut off the second they stepped inside.

The temperature dropped right away, cooler and still, with that old library smell. Paper, wood polish, something musty underneath. Cody's eyes took a second to adjust. The ceiling was high, vaulted and dark, held up by thick wooden beams that looked like they'd been there forever. Somewhere deeper in the building, a radiator clanked and hissed, fighting the autumn cold.

The main floor stretched out in rows of tall shelves, packed tight with books whose spines showed every shade of old. Cracked leather, faded cloth, gold letters worn to nothing. Reading tables sat between the stacks, green-shaded lamps on each one, gray morning light coming through the tall windows.

A few students hunched over textbooks and laptops. A raccoon in reading glasses. A deer with antlers so wide he'd claimed a whole table for himself. A bunch of mice sharing one oversized chair.

Cody's pattern brain read the room automatically. The raccoon was stressed, flipping pages too fast, not retaining anything. The deer was calm, methodical, probably a senior who'd done this a hundred times. The mice were studying together but one of them kept checking her phone. Group project drama, probably.

*Stop it,* he told himself. *Focus.*

A massive circulation desk sat in the center of the room, carved from dark wood and cluttered with return carts and stamp pads. A sleepy-looking owl staffed it, feathers ruffled, barely glancing up as they passed.

Their shoes scuffed against the floor, and somewhere a clock ticked. That was it for noise. Lukas led him past the reference stacks, tail low, eyes checking the rows.

"Third carrel on the left," Lukas whispered. "She's already waving at us."

Cody looked up, risking being seen. And there, tucked into a study carrel near the back wall, a flash of red fur caught the lamplight.

A slim fox in an oversized cardigan waved from behind a small fortress of stacked books and a beat-up laptop. Her fur was a bright reddish-orange, brighter at the tips of her ears and along her tail. A mechanical pencil stuck out of the fur behind one ear like she'd forgotten about it.

Her amber eyes flicked to Cody, went wide for a second, then snapped back to Lukas with a look that said questions were lining up behind her teeth.

His pattern brain caught the rest. The way she leaned forward, not back. Curious, not threatened. The slight tilt of her head, cataloging him the same way he was cataloging her. The tap of her finger on the desk, impatient but controlled.

*She's smart,* he thought. *And she knows it.*

Lukas held up a palm. *Later.*

"Gem, this is Cody. Human, lost, portal mystery." He tilted his head toward the fox. "Cody, Gem. Campus dictionary with a tail."

Cody looked at those wide amber eyes and did his best to smile. "Um. Hi."

Gem's ears twitched, curiosity practically buzzing off her. She leaned forward over the carrel desk, pencil almost falling out of her fur. "Human? Like, actual skin, no fur?" She caught herself, cleared her throat, and sat back. "Right. Sorry. Research mode." She closed her laptop and stood, slinging a messenger bag over her shoulder. "Good news: I found your flavor of weird. Bad news: I need to poke at you a little to confirm it. But not here." She glanced at the library entrance, then back. Her voice dropped lower than necessary. "Too many ears. We need to go downstairs."

She led them through the stacks toward the back of the building, past rows of shelves that got older and dustier the farther they went. They reached an alcove where an ancient elevator sat behind a brass gate, the kind with an accordion door that looked like it belonged in a black-and-white movie.

Gem pulled the gate open with a screech of metal. "Special Collections. Basement level. It's where they keep the weird stuff." She grinned at Cody. "You'll fit right in."

The elevator groaned as it went down, cables creaking overhead. Cody watched the floors tick by through the gate. Main floor, then a long stretch of nothing, then a shudder and a stop.

The basement was a different world.

The ceiling hung low, close enough that Lukas's ears almost touched it. The air was heavier down here, thick with the smell of old paper and dust that had been settling for decades. Glass cases lined the walls, filled with books too old or too strange for the main collection. Wooden card catalogs stood between reading alcoves like guards, brass handles gone green. The lighting came from old gas lamps that had been converted to electric, and they flickered like they weren't sure about the upgrade.

A security camera sat in the far corner. Small, easy to miss. But Cody's pattern brain caught it.

Gem led them to a back corner where a heavy wooden table sat surrounded by stacks of open books and ancient tomes. She dropped her bag on a chair and started pulling out supplies: a small plastic baggie, a vial of silver dust, a stopwatch.

The corner she'd chosen put a bookshelf between them and the camera. Coincidence? Cody doubted it.

"Welcome to my office," she said. "Well, my unofficial office. Officially I'm not supposed to be down here without a faculty escort, but Professor Whitmore owes me for fixing his citations last semester." She flipped open a thick book, one claw tapping a hand-drawn circle on the yellowed page. "Now. Let's see what flavor of weird you actually are."

Cody kept his mouth shut. Lukas had told him to let her talk, let her get what she needed. If she asked questions, he'd answer. Otherwise, zip it.

But he was watching. Reading her movements, her confidence, the way she handled the materials like she'd done this before. This wasn't improvised. She'd prepared.

*She was already looking into this before we got here,* he realized. *Lukas must have told her last night.*

Lukas leaned over Gem's shoulder, looking at the inked symbols. "Timeline?"

"Two hours for the sigil to set, plus whatever juice ripped the hole open." Gem's eyes flicked to Cody, sizing him up. "Residue sticks to whoever falls through. You're basically a walking receipt."

Lukas nodded once, then turned to Cody. "She needs a sample. Hair, spit, whatever's easiest."

Cody blinked. The timing seemed almost too neat. "So hold on. You're telling me this is a totally normal thing that happens here? If that's the case, this portal can be opened any time?"

Gem snorted. "Normal? Please. Documented is not the same as normal." She tapped the page in front of her. "Portals leave fingerprints. Emotional spikes, time residue, the whole messy package. I map the print, I guess when the door might swing again. Could be tomorrow. Could be never." She leaned forward, pencil spinning between her fingers. "That's why we test now instead of lighting candles and hoping."

"So you're basically telling me it's decision time."

"Decision time was yesterday," Lukas said quietly, "when you landed in pine needles."

"What he said." Gem shrugged. "We test, we wait, we see if the door still remembers you. If it does, you get a choice. If it doesn't, welcome to Timberwood, population: you."

Cody's chest tightened. "Okay, okay, okay. It just seems so sudden. I didn't think I'd need to make this decision this fast." He swallowed. "But Gem, when I landed here, I didn't do any ritual that needed blood, hair, or a chant. Are you sure this is going to work?"

"Rituals are for drama queens." Gem leaned back in her chair, grinning. "Portals don't ask permission. They yank, they toss, they leave lint behind. I just read the lint." She pulled a sterile Q-tip from the baggie. "Swab inside your cheek. Thirty seconds. No biting, no overthinking."

"Okay. So what do you want me to do? Just hand you a swab?"

Gem held out the Q-tip across the table. "Twirl it inside your cheek. Thirty seconds, no biting." She set the little stopwatch on the wood next to her elbow. Lukas shifted his weight, putting his back to the nearest aisle, blocking the view while Gem uncapped the vial of silver dust.

Cody did what he was told, watching the whole thing with detached curiosity. The swab felt weird and clinical against the inside of his mouth, seconds ticking by in the basement quiet.

When he handed it back, Gem sprinkled the dust over the damp cotton. It stuck there like frost for a second, then lit up purple. Cody's breath caught.

Gem's head tilted. Her pencil stopped tapping.

For a second, the purple flickered. Something underneath. Amber? Gold? Gone before Cody could be sure he'd seen it.

Gem blinked. Her ears flattened, then relaxed. She glanced at Cody, then back at the glow, then made a small note in the margin of her book. Didn't say anything.

"There we go." Her voice was steady, but her pencil was tapping again. Faster than before. "Fourteen hours since the door opened. Emotional signature reads panic spiking into relief." She glanced at Lukas, one ear cocked. "Your stray checks out."

Lukas breathed out through his nose. "Window?"

"Hard to say exactly." She wiggled her fingers at the fading glow. "Resonance doesn't snap shut like a door. It fades. You've got maybe a week before the signal's too weak to punch through." She met Cody's eyes. "After that, the trail goes cold and I can't promise anything. Door might crack open next year, might stay shut forever."

Cody did the math. "A week."

"Give or take a day." Gem shut the book. The note she'd written disappeared with it. "Enough time to figure things out. Not enough to waste."

A week. The number landed in Cody's head and just sat there.

He thought about what was waiting for him back home. The apartment. His father. The bus rides to a campus where nobody knew his name. The job at the burger place, grease under his fingernails, counting down the hours until he could leave.

Then he thought about this place. The stares, sure. The confusion. But also the coffee this morning, and Lukas blocking the gawkers, and a fox who'd spent her night researching how to help a stranger.

*A week to decide.*

"So I'm here for the next few days, play tourist, and then decide to leave or stay." He tried to sound casual. "Simple enough, I guess."

"Tourist, refugee, transfer student." Lukas hooked a thumb toward the elevator. "Pick your label. Dorms stay open, cafeteria still serves. We'll keep you off the front page till you figure things out."

"So what now?"

Lukas tapped Gem's notes into his phone, fingers moving fast. Time stamp, location, residue color. "Now we get out of here. Library's got ears, even down here." He tilted his head toward the elevator. "Back exit, then food. You've got time to decide if Earth still owns you. No point doing it hungry."

Cody turned back to Gem. Something about how she'd handled all this, quick and capable and curious without being pushy, made him want to say something.

"Thanks, Gem."

The fox flicked a two-finger salute, quick and easy. "Don't do anything boring, human. I'll be disappointed."

The elevator groaned back up to the main floor, and Lukas led them toward a back stairwell Cody hadn't seen before. They climbed one flight and pushed through a door that opened onto a side path behind the library.

Late morning light hit the quad, brighter now than when they'd gone in. The gray clouds had thinned out, letting patches of blue show through. Students crossed the paths in loose groups, backpacks over shoulders, voices carrying in the cold air.

Cody blinked at the sky, surprised how much time had passed in there.

"Keep the notes buried," Lukas called back toward the closing door, knowing Gem couldn't hear him but saying it anyway. "If Rumi sniffs this out, he'll turn it into locker room legend."

He turned to Cody.

"Pancakes or noodles?" Lukas asked, already moving. "You've got one last easy decision before the big ones."

# Chapter 7: Duck Noodles

"Noodles," Cody said. "Definitely noodles."

Lukas grunted and steered them away from the library, cutting across a corner of the quad toward one of the smaller paths. The brick underfoot was still dark with overnight moisture, and fallen leaves had gathered in soggy clumps along the edges.

A few students glanced their way as they passed. A rabbit did a double-take. A pair of foxes whispered to each other after Cody walked by. His pattern brain cataloged them automatically. The rabbit was surprised but not hostile, ears up, body language open. The foxes were curious, leaning toward each other, probably comparing notes. Neither group moved to follow or confront. Gossip, not threat. Lukas kept moving, his bulk blocking most of the sight lines. Two campus security officers walked past on the main path. Casual pace. But their eyes found Cody. Held for a beat too long. Lukas's ear twitched. He didn't say anything. Just waited until they'd passed, then picked up the pace slightly.

They skirted the edge of a dormitory Cody didn't recognize, windows dark, laundry hanging from a few balconies despite the cold. The path narrowed here, winding between the building and a row of bare hedges that had probably been green a month ago.

The late morning air still carried the bite of October, cutting through Cody's thin jacket. But the wind had died down, making the cold more bearable. Fallen leaves crunched under their feet, and somewhere nearby the smell of woodsmoke drifted from a maintenance building's chimney.

Then a new smell cut through. Sesame, garlic, something rich and savory.

A food cart sat ahead, wreathed in steam and sizzle. A stocky badger in a grease-stained apron worked the wok, tossing noodles with practiced flicks of the wrist. Early lunch crowd, or maybe just the perpetually hungry, huddled around the cart with their collars turned up against the chill. Cody's stomach growled loud enough that Lukas's ear flicked.

Lukas nodded at the vendor. "Two duck broth bowls. Extra scallion."

The badger's eyes flicked to Cody, lingered for half a second, then returned to the wok without comment.

Cody read him instantly. The slight pause, the neutral expression, the deliberate return to work. Professional. Discreet. He'd clocked that Cody was human and decided it wasn't his business. Either he'd seen weirder or Lukas was a regular.

Probably both.

They found a low stone wall nearby and sat. The stone was cold through Cody's jeans, but the bowl Lukas handed him radiated warmth, steam curling between them in the autumn air.

Across the quad, near the science building, someone stood with a clipboard. A deer in a white coat, checking something on a list, then looking up. Scanning.

Their gaze swept across the quad. Found Cody. Lingered.

Then they turned and walked inside.

Cody blinked. When he looked again, they were gone.

*Something's watching,* his pattern brain whispered. *You don't know what yet. But something.*

The first sip hit Cody's tongue and he almost groaned. Rich, salty, deeply savory, with noodles that had just enough chew. It tasted like ramen from back home, if ramen had been made by someone who actually gave a damn.

"Thanks, man." Cody let the warmth settle into his chest, chasing out the chill from the walk. "This is really good. Reminds me of ramen back home, but better."

Lukas huffed, something that might've been a laugh. "Vendor's been here longer than most of the faculty. Knows what he's doing." He slurped his noodles, unbothered. "You've got time to figure out if this bowl tastes better than anything waiting for you back home. No rush. Just eat."

Cody let the broth warm him, watching students drift past in the thin midday light. A few leaves skittered across the brick path, pushed by a gust that made him hunch deeper over his bowl. A week, Gem said. Time to decide if he wanted to stay or go.

The math was simple. The answer was not.

What was waiting for him back there, really? An empty apartment that smelled like bourbon and regret. A father who'd stopped being a father years ago. A community college where he was nobody, going nowhere, for no reason he could name.

Here, at least, he was interesting. Here, someone had bothered to feed him.

"Hey," Cody said, quieter now. "I don't know how to say this without sounding weird, but you've been really decent to me. Someone who just popped into existence out of nowhere." He turned the bowl in his hands, letting the heat soak into his fingers. "Is there some way I can repay you? I feel guilty just taking advantage of your hospitality."

Lukas swirled his noodles, eyes on the broth. "Repay me by not bleeding on the carpet." A pause. "Or signing autographs for Rumi's fan club."

"Who's Rumi?"

"Teammate. Thinks humans are cooler than they are." Lukas lifted a brow. "Hospitality's cheap. Curiosity's expensive. You're paying just by staying interesting. Don't spoil it."

"Staying interesting?" Cody snorted. "Besides being one of the rarest creatures that popped up, this is me, man. Just boring old Cody with a boring old life."

"Boring doesn't step through a hole in the sky." Lukas tipped the bowl back, draining the last of the broth. "You're a blank page in a library that thinks it's read everything. That's currency here. Keep turning."

Cody sighed, staring into the remnants of his own bowl. "Lukas, dude. Put yourself in my shoes. I'm scared that at any moment, someone's gonna decide I'm more interesting as a research subject than a person. It's a lot to take in."

Lukas set his bowl down. His eyes flicked briefly toward the science building visible across the quad, then back to Cody. When he spoke, his voice was lower, steadier.

"You landed on a campus, not in a lab." Those amber eyes held Cody's, unblinking. "You're a person first. Everything else is noise."

The words were calm, but something in the set of Lukas's jaw said he meant them. Cody noticed the way the wolf's ears stayed alert, tracking movement at the edges of his vision even while they talked. Always watching. Always ready.

"Fear's loud," Lukas continued, "but it's not the only voice. Listen for the quiet one that says you're still breathing. That's the one that gets you home, or keeps you here." He stood, stacking both bowls. "Either way, you decide. Nobody else."

Cody let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. "So should I blend in or make myself seem mysterious?"

"Blend till you're bored of it. Then flash something weird." Lukas handed the bowls back to the badger vendor with a nod. "Keeps the gossip circling at a safe distance." He turned back to Cody. "Come on. Tour first. Back gates, river path, the hollow tree that supposedly eats secrets. You can decide which ones to feed it."

Cody pushed himself off the wall. "Dude, really. If you ever need anything, I'm grateful. Happy to share whatever I've got."

"Need something?" Lukas started down the brick path, hands in his pockets. "Stick around. Story's still writing itself."

*Story's still writing itself.*

Cody followed, hands shoved in his jacket pockets against the cold. For the first time since he'd landed in the pine needles, the weight in his chest felt a little lighter.

# Chapter 8: Under the Stadium

The tour stretched through the afternoon.

Lukas showed him the back gates at the far edge of campus, past the stadium. Chain-link and concrete, the kind of place that looked like it belonged behind a warehouse. Delivery trucks idled in a loading bay, and a raccoon in a safety vest waved them through without a second glance. "If you ever need to leave campus without being seen," Lukas said, "this is where you do it." Cody filed that away. Escape route. Good to know. A security camera sat on the corner of the loading bay, pointed at the gate. Cody noticed Lukas position himself to block the angle as they passed.

Then the old gymnasium behind the athletic complex. A squat brick building with windows so clouded you couldn't see through them anymore. The place smelled like a hundred years of sweat and chalk, the kind of smell that gets into the walls and never leaves. Ropes hung from the ceiling like they'd given up, and medicine balls sat in the corners gathering dust. "Team used to practice here before they built the new fieldhouse," Lukas said. "Now it's just storage and nostalgia."

A courtyard tucked between two buildings, where a statue of some dead badger stood in fancy robes with one paw raised. Cornelius Hollowell, the plaque said. Founded the university, died before it was finished, got a library named after him. The benches around the edges were covered in soggy leaves that nobody had bothered to clean up.

They grabbed sandwiches from a campus café near the student union. The kind of place with mismatched furniture and coffee that smelled better than it probably tasted. They sat on a bench outside while Lukas pointed out which buildings to avoid and which shortcuts actually saved time.

Cody's pattern brain was working again, mapping the campus layout. Main paths, side routes, sight lines. Where you could be seen and where you couldn't. Lukas was handing him a survival guide without calling it one.

The science building loomed across the way like a threat. Beyond it, the admin offices where the dean worked, windows dark like nobody was home.

But somebody was. Cody caught movement in one of the upper windows. A shape, there and gone. Could have been anyone. Could have been nothing.

*Something's watching.*

He looked away before Lukas noticed him staring.

By the time they reached the fountain plaza, the sun was starting to go down. The fountain itself was empty, drained for winter, just a big stone bowl with nothing in it. But the late afternoon light made everything look golden, like the world was trying to pretty itself up before bed.

"First real stop," Lukas said, nodding toward a path that led to some scraggly willows. "The footbridge. At midnight the koi rise like they're listening. Nobody knows why. You can decide if they're judging or just curious."

They walked down a slope past the willows, their bare branches dragging in the breeze like wet hair. The footbridge was just a stone arch over a slow stream that spread out into a pond on the other side. Cody stepped onto it and leaned on the rail, looking down at the water. The sky was doing that thing where afternoon turns into evening, all orange and pink on the surface like someone spilled paint.

Lukas leaned on the rail next to him, claws clicking on the stone. "They're down there. Ghost white koi, big as your thigh. Watch the swirl when the clock hits twelve. They spell things, if you're drunk enough to believe it." A breeze ruffled the thick fur on his neck. He shook it off. "Place likes collecting questions. Toss one in. See if it floats."

"You make it sound like the lake's a magic eight ball," Cody said. "Answer unclear, try again later."

"Magic eight ball with scales." Lukas chuckled, low and warm. "Only answers when it's hungry." He flicked a pebble into the water. It plinked and disappeared. "Still better odds than my playbook."

Cody stared at the water for a while. Then, quiet, he talked to it.

"Is this my new home?"

Nothing happened. No ripple, no flash of white fish. Just the water sitting there and the sound of students laughing somewhere far off.

Lukas breathed out through his nose. "Silence works too. Means it's your call." He pushed off the rail. "Come on. Tree's next."

"Or like I said," Cody followed, "ask again later."

They headed down a dirt path through some massive old oaks. The light was fading fast now, that time of day when everything starts looking gray around the edges. The hollow oak sat in a clearing up ahead, trunk split down the middle like a mouth frozen mid-yawn. The bark was dark and twisted, and coins lay around the base, green from sitting out in the weather for who knows how long.

"Drop something inside," Lukas said, dragging a claw along the bark. "Coin, wrapper, regret. Campus superstition says the tree keeps it quiet. I say it just rots slower than we do."

"Isn't that the same thing, really?" Cody tilted his head.

Lukas shrugged. "Close enough." He tapped the hollow. "Toss it or keep it. Either way, the tree's eating tonight."

"Do I need to announce it? Like some ancient mystic chant or a lamb sacrifice?" Cody grinned, hoping Lukas got the joke. If he was going to be here a while, might as well try to be decent company.

Lukas showed a fang. Almost a smile. "Skip the lamb. Cafeteria's already overbooked." He tapped the hollow again. "Just whisper it. Tree's got good ears. Or bad memory, depending on how you look at it."

Cody leaned close to the trunk and fake-whispered into the dark hole. "I regret that I forgot my camera at home."

The tree creaked, old wood settling. That was it.

Lukas tilted an ear. "Tree's polite. Didn't laugh." He looked up at the sky, which was turning purple now, first stars poking through like someone had poked holes in a blanket. "One more stop. River bend. Water's cold. Clears your head." He glanced at Cody. "Then dorm. You look like you could use the sleep."

Cody followed him.

They went downhill through thicker brush, past an old stone wall that was mostly rubble now. The trees got denser, blocking out what little light was left. Lukas pushed through some willow branches and the river opened up in front of them. The water was dark and flat, sliding around a pale sandbar like it had all the time in the world. The air smelled like wet rocks and cold dirt.

"Here's where I come when I need to think," Lukas said. "Cold enough to wake you up."

He kicked off one boot and let the water touch his paw. "Dip a toe or jump in. Your call."

Cody crouched at the edge, pulled off his shoe and sock, and stuck his toe in.

He yanked it back like he'd touched a hot stove, except the opposite. "Whoa. That's cold."

He tried again. Winced. Jerked back. Tried again. Finally got his foot in and kept it there, teeth clenched so hard his jaw hurt.

Lukas watched him fight it, smirk pulling at his muzzle. "River's a bully. Likes watching us flinch." He stepped in next to Cody, fur going flat against his leg, muscles tight. "Reminds me of two-a-days. Cold showers after practice. You get used to it."

Cody thought about that. The white light. All those emotions slamming into him at once. The pressure on his chest, that moment when he really thought he might be dying. Then the black. The nothing. Waking up on pine needles with a wolf staring down at him.

"The cold part, maybe," he said. His foot was going numb. "That last second before everything went dark." He hissed as the cold crept higher. "But I'll tell you one thing. I'm not a polar bear. And I'm not putting more than my foot in here, which, by the way, I'm beginning to lose feeling in."

"Yeah, you've got the wrong blood for this." Lukas splashed out, shaking his leg, water flying off like tiny knives. He held out a paw to pull Cody up. "Feeling's overrated anyway. You'll walk again in five."

"Better to feel something than nothing at all." Cody grabbed the paw. Rough pads, warm against his palm.

Lukas hauled him up like he weighed nothing. "Come on, before your toes declare independence."

Cody hopped on one foot, yanking his sock back on. "They definitely feel like they just declared war."

Pins and needles hit when he shoved his foot back in his shoe. Sharp and prickling, like his foot was waking up angry. He laced up fast and limped a few steps, making a face.

The wind picked up as they headed back toward the dorms, cutting through his jacket. Cody shoved his hands in his pockets and followed Lukas up the hill.

---


# Chapter 9: Baggage Revealed

Lukas started up the deer track toward the distant glow of campus, and Cody limped after him, pins and needles still firing through his foot with every step.

The walk back was quieter. Night had kicked in for real, sky full of stars he didn't recognize. Cody found himself looking up between the branches, wondering if any of them were the same as back home. Probably not. Different universe, different sky. The thought should've hit harder than it did. His foot was starting to feel normal again by the time Lukas spoke.

"You'll limp, swear, then forget it by breakfast. Same as every rookie night."

Cody's pattern brain caught the words. Playbook. Blitz. Rookie. He'd been noticing them all evening. "So I take it you're the captain of something on this campus. And judging by the terms you're using, football? Quarterback? Linebacker?"

"Linebacker." Lukas grunted, boots crunching over frost that had started forming on the grass. "Quarterback gets the parade. I get the bruises."

"Figures." Cody huffed. "You've got the look and the personality of a linebacker."

Lukas snorted, breath fogging in the cold. "Look's accidental. Personality's collateral damage." He glanced sideways. "You clocked that fast for somebody who claims he doesn't watch the sport."

Something tightened in Cody's chest. The question was harmless enough, but it poked at stuff he didn't like thinking about.

"I used to play," he said. The words came out flatter than he meant. "High school. Wasn't bad at it, either."

Lukas's ears swiveled, catching the shift. "Used to?"

Cody kept his eyes on the path. The memories were right there, pushing at the edges: the stadium lights, the crowd noise, the other player's taunt hitting too close to home. The way his vision went red. The way the coaches had to drag him off.

The way everyone looked at him after.

"Didn't work out," he said. Short. Done. Door closed.

Lukas was quiet for a few steps. Then: "Fair enough."

He didn't push. Didn't pry. Just let the silence sit there, easy enough that Cody's shoulders slowly loosened up.

Cody's pattern brain noted that too. Most people would have asked follow-up questions. Lukas just... let it go. Filed it away without demanding more.

"Boyfriend was a defensive lineman, though," Cody added, steering toward safer ground. "After I quit. All I remember now are a few terms and the basic rules."

Lukas's ears flicked, taking the redirect. "So the playbook's not completely foreign territory."

"Pretty much."

"Hope he treated you better than turf treats cleats." The path widened ahead of them, dorm lights starting to poke through the trees.

Cody was quiet for a second. Then: "He left me for the quarterback."

Lukas stopped mid-stride, paw tightening on his bag strap. His jaw worked for a second. "His loss."

That was it. Two words. But the way Lukas said them, low and certain, made them land heavier than a whole speech would have.

"I suppose." Cody shrugged. "Add it to the pile."

Lukas started walking again. "Pile gets lighter when you stop counting." He nodded toward the lit windows ahead. "Warm water, dry socks, door that locks. Almost there."

Cody shoved his hands into his jacket pockets and followed.

The dorm's side door opened with a rush of warmth, like stepping in front of an open oven. Lukas held it for him. "Elevator's busted. Three flights. You want the shower first or the couch?" They climbed the stairs, Cody's calves burning by the second landing. The stairwell smelled like old concrete and that fake pine cleaner that never actually smells like pine. By the time they hit the third floor, he was breathing harder than he wanted to admit. Lukas pushed through the fire door and led him down a hallway full of identical doors. He stopped at one near the middle and unlocked it.

"Home," Lukas said, pushing the door open.

The place was small but it worked. Open room that doubled as kitchen and living area, the kind of setup that screamed college athlete on a budget. Counter along the left wall with a sink at one end, dorm fridge underneath. Coffee maker, portable cooktop, and microwave all lined up. Past that, a fold-out couch faced a TV on the opposite wall, maybe fifty inches, with gaming consoles underneath. Desk to the left, coffee table in the middle.

Two doors at the far end of the right wall. Lukas nodded at them. "Half bath on the left if you need it. Bedroom's on the right." He dropped his bag by the couch. "Communal showers are down the hall. Four heads, no privacy, but the water's hot if you get there before Thorne."

"Thorne?"

"Floormate. Bear. Showers like he's trying to drown the whole building." Lukas shrugged. "You'll meet him eventually. Him and Benji both live on this floor."

Cody stood in the doorway, looking around. The place was lived in but not trashed. Few dishes drying in a rack. Team jacket on a chair. Through the half-open bedroom door, he could see trophies on a shelf and a football on a stand.

His pattern brain was cataloging again. The trophies said Lukas was good at what he did. The dishes in the rack said he cleaned up after himself. The gaming rig said he had a life outside football. The spare blanket already folded on the couch said he'd been expecting to offer it.

*He planned for this. Before we even got back.*

"Dude, it's your home. I'm good with whatever's left over."

Lukas's ears went flat for a second. "You're the guest. Guests get first crack at anything that steams." He jabbed a claw toward the hallway. "Communal shower's second door on the left. Cabinet in there has towels. Take your time."

"You sure? I really don't want to feel like a burden."

"You're not." Lukas dropped onto the couch and stretched his legs out. "Go. Before Thorne wakes up and decides he needs a midnight soak."

Cody stepped into the hallway, then turned back. "Hey, Lukas?"

Lukas looked up. "Yeah?"

"Thanks, man."

The communal shower was exactly what Lukas said: four shower heads in an open room, no stalls, couple of empty towel racks on the wall. Cody found the cabinet, grabbed a towel, and kept it quick. Five minutes, just enough to get the cold out of his bones. Water pressure was better than he expected.

He dried off, wrapped the towel around his waist, and walked back to Lukas's door.

"All yours," he said, stepping inside. "Water's still hot."

Lukas looked up from the couch. "Good." He stood and tossed Cody a spare shirt, soft and faded from being washed a million times. "Throw that on. Gets cold after a shower." He grabbed a towel from the cabinet by the half bath. "Back in ten."

"I'm not that tired," Cody said, pulling the shirt over his head. It was a little tight across the shoulders, but warm. "My mind still has a million thoughts. Only reason I think I was able to sleep last night is portal symptoms."

Lukas paused at the door. "If the thoughts get loud, headphones are on the desk. Otherwise, raid the fridge. Just save me one yogurt." The door clicked shut.

Cody felt the shirt settle against his skin. He sat down heavy on the couch.

*He seems like a nice dude,* Cody thought. *But is he putting on airs? Or does he think I'm some kind of curiosity?*

Back in his world, Cody rarely had anyone treat him decent. Not once they got to know him. Not once they saw the parts he couldn't hide: the intensity, the weird interests, the way his brain wandered into places most people didn't follow. He tugged at the hem of the borrowed shirt.

*I'm just a complete stranger. A nobody. The only thing interesting about me here is that I'm not covered in fur.*

He leaned back, staring at the ceiling.

*Maybe he's just being friendly. Rough around the edges, but real.* But most of the friends Cody had ever made ended up ditching him. Too intense. Too much. And it was too soon to decide about going home. He'd only met two people in this entire world, and two more he'd never even seen.

Too many thoughts.

The door opened and Lukas came in, towel over his shoulders, fur still damp. His eyes found Cody right away.

"Still up. Good." He caught the way Cody was swimming in the borrowed shirt, the faraway look in his eyes. "Fridge is yours if you're hungry. Couch folds out when you're ready."

He grabbed the spare blanket from the closet and tossed it over.

Cody caught the blanket. "Can I ask you something?"

Lukas dropped onto the other end of the couch. "Shoot."

"Why are you being nice to me?"

Lukas let out a long breath. "Because you're cold, alone, and wearing my shirt like a kid swimming in his dad's jacket." He leaned back. "And because I've been the new guy. Transfer year, only wolf on a team of bears. Someone gave me a break once. Figured I'd pass it on."

"Yeah, but Lukas, back in my world, nicety always came with a price. Sometimes too steep." Cody pulled the blanket across his lap. "I've had friends bail on me because I was always too much. Too intense. Too weird. The kind of guy people hang out with until they realize I'm not going to tone it down."

He looked at the floor.

"I've had relationships that always ended bad. Either a broken heart or broken furniture. Lost my mom when I was a kid and my father couldn't give two shits if I lived or died." He looked up. "And then one day, poof, here I am in a new world and I see you staring at me. And not only are you not hostile, but you're offering a room, food, something to wear, lending an ear."

He spread his hands.

"See where I'm going with this?"

Lukas was quiet for a moment. "Yeah. I get it." He leaned forward, elbows on knees. "No price. No angle. I've got teammates who ditched me after one bad game. An ex who told everyone I was cold. A whole year where nobody knew what to do with the transfer wolf." He shrugged. "We've both got baggage. Difference is, tonight I've got a spare couch. That's it."

"Yeah, but why?" Cody shook his head. "Sorry, I'm sounding like a broken record."

"Because I wanted to." Lukas met his eyes. "That's the whole reason. No ledger."

Cody stared at him. The words hit somewhere in his chest and stayed there.

"And you're even listening to me dump all this on you." His voice came out quieter than he expected. "Honestly, it's been a long time since I've had someone I could actually talk to."

Lukas's ears twitched. He was quiet for a moment, like he was weighing something.

"Door's open," he said finally. "Whenever you need it."

He stood up, stretched, joints popping like someone stepping on bubble wrap. Then he leaned down and pulled the couch open, frame unfolding into a bed with a soft clunk. He grabbed linens from the ottoman and tossed them on the mattress. "Blanket's warm, mattress is lumpy. Fair warning." He clicked the lamp off. Moonlight came through the blinds, cutting the room into pale stripes. "I'll be in the other room if you need anything." He stopped at the bedroom door. "Night, Cody."

"Night, Lukas." A pause. Then, quieter: "Thanks for not running."

Lukas looked back. Something shifted in his expression, just for a second. "Wasn't planning on it." He pulled the door mostly shut.

The thoughts came, just like Cody knew they would. Too many to sort through. He'd just dumped a massive chunk of his life on a complete stranger, and Lukas hadn't told him to get lost. Hadn't backed away because of all the red flags.

He lay there for what felt like hours, old memories floating around behind his eyes. And here he was, the living answer to something he'd wondered about since he was a kid. What if animals could walk and talk? Turns out they were rough on the outside but had big hearts.

Going back home felt less likely by the minute.

Finally his eyes closed. He'd just unloaded years of baggage on a stranger who didn't flinch. Didn't run. And somewhere under all the exhaustion, something unfamiliar settled into his chest.

Safe.

Lukas stayed by the cracked door, listening to Cody's breathing go slow and even.

He watched for a while, then padded to the kitchen counter, poured a glass of water, watched the moonlight slide across it. One more look at the living area: Cody was curled up tight on the fold-out, shirt sleeves swallowed past his knuckles.

Lukas left the glass on the counter. No note.

Sometime in the middle of the night, Cody woke up. Thirst dragged him off the fold-out and toward the kitchen. He reached for the cabinet, then stopped. A full glass of water sat on the counter.

He looked left, then right. Did someone wake up and forget? Was it Lukas?

Thirsty as hell, Cody grabbed the glass and drank. He rinsed it, stuck it in the dish rack, then shuffled back to the fold-out. His eyes closed before his head hit the pillow.

In the bedroom, Lukas heard the faucet, the soft clink of glass. He stayed still, one ear pointed at the door he'd left cracked. When the mattress springs creaked again, he let out a slow breath.

Good.

He closed his eyes and let everything go quiet.

# Chapter 10: The Weight of Maybe

Morning came with an alarm from the other room.

Cody opened his eyes to daylight bleeding through the blinds, the fold-out creaking under him like it was complaining. For a second he forgot where he was. Then it all came back: the dorm, the wolf, the portal, the world full of walking, talking animals. Right. Still here. He sat up and stretched, spine cracking like knuckles. Three hours of sleep, maybe. Call it portal jet lag. Call it whatever made sense, because nothing else did.

The alarm cut off with a slap. Footsteps padded from the bedroom, and Lukas shuffled into the living area, fur mashed flat on one side like he'd slept on it wrong, athletic shorts hanging low. He scratched at his ribs with one paw, yawning wide enough to show every fang.

"Morning." Lukas glanced at the fold-out, then at Cody. "Coffee's brewing. Smells like burnt optimism, but it works."

Cody swung his legs off the mattress. "Morning to you too. You sound almost cheerful."

"Don't get used to it." Lukas moved toward the kitchen counter, where the coffee maker was already gurgling away. "You want the shower before Thorne hogs the hot water, now's your window."

"Shower's all Thorne's." Cody stood, rolling the stiffness out of his shoulders. "Humans usually only need one a day. Coffee, though. Always up for coffee."

Lukas poured two mugs, the stuff coming out black as tar. "Black enough to bite back. Help yourself."

Cody took the mug and wrapped both hands around it, letting the heat soak into his palms. The first sip hit his tongue, bitter and strong, and something in his brain finally kicked on.

"Too bad I forgot to pack deodorant on my portal trip," he said. "Wait. Deodorant exists in this world?"

Lukas snorted. "We sweat, we stink, we invented sticks to fix it. Same as you." He nodded toward the hallway. "Thorne keeps a spare in the communal bathroom. Smells like pine. Help yourself."

Cody thought about it. Then: "Nah, I'm good. I'll take the stinky pits."

"Bold strategy." Lukas raised an eyebrow. "Just don't sit upwind of Gem. She'll spritz you with something and call it an intervention." He wrinkled his nose. "Your call, stinky. But the couch might file for asylum."

Cody sighed. "Fine, fine. Only because you threatened the couch." He set his mug down and headed for the hallway. "I'll use the deodorant of one of your floormates I've never met and hope he doesn't mind human stink on his stuff."

"Thorne's shared worse. Locker room diplomacy." Lukas smirked. "If he gives you a look, tell him it's interspecies cultural exchange."

Cody found the communal bathroom, found the deodorant, and put it on quick. Pine and something else he couldn't name. When he walked back into the dorm, Lukas was leaning against the counter, mug in hand.

"There. Done." Cody spread his arms. "Now if the bear attacks me, I'm hiding behind you."

"Thorne's harmless. Quiet type." Lukas looked him over. "I'm a linebacker, not a shield. You're on your own if he decides to ask questions."

"Fucker."

The word came out with a laugh attached. A real laugh, not the fake polite kind he'd learned to crank out when he had to. This one caught him off guard, coming up from somewhere he didn't know he still had.

Lukas caught it. His ears twitched, something flickering in those amber eyes. He held Cody's gaze a beat longer than he needed to.

"First real one I've heard from you," he said, voice dropping. "Keep them coming."

Cody shook his head, still smiling. "No promises. What's the agenda today? Mystical portals? Talking carp? Paintings that come to life?"

Lukas rinsed his mug in the sink. "Library first. Gem wants to check the resonance. Then breakfast, low profile. After that?" He shrugged. "Could show you the stadium tunnels. Ghost stories and stale nachos. Or we sit tight and let you think. Your clock, your call."

"Unfortunately, you designated yourself as the tour guide." Cody finished his coffee. "So lead on. I'm just the tourist."

"Tour guide gets hazard pay," Lukas muttered, but he was already moving toward the door. "Fine. Library, then tunnels. You can decide if the bleachers smell like glory or nacho regret." He paused. "Grab that shirt. Concrete's cold."

Cody pulled on the borrowed shirt from last night and followed Lukas out. The morning air had that bite to it, the campus quieter than the day before.

"Hey," Cody said as they walked. "Not that I mind borrowing clothes, but is there somewhere I can find something that actually fits? I have some money..." He trailed off, remembering. Different world. Different money. "Sorry. Never mind. Tight shirt it is."

Lukas flicked an ear. "Campus store opens at nine. Human section's two racks near the back. I've got meal points to burn." He tossed Cody a worn canvas tote. "Till then, suffer the shirt. Makes you look like a lost pup. Campus security loves that."

"By the way," Cody asked as they crossed the quad, "whose shirts have I been wearing?"

"Mine." Lukas didn't slow down. "Washed, if that matters."

"Really? Dude, did you bulk up during college? These are tight on me, and looking at you, I'd expect something baggier."

Lukas flexed a shoulder, fur bristling a little. "Freshman year me. Haven't worn it since I quit swimming. Shoulders kept growing." He flicked the sleeve riding up Cody's wrist. "Consider it a loan, not a hand-me-down. Stretch it and I'll make you run laps."

"How many days are you willing to wait for me to complete one?"

Lukas snorted. "One. After that I'm tying you to the goalpost and letting the kicker practice."

Cody laughed again, easier this time. "Fucker. Now I owe you for two."

"Tab's open." Lukas showed teeth in what might've been a grin. "Keep laughing and I'll own your soul by dinner."

Cody's pattern brain noted the route. Lukas wasn't taking the main paths. He cut behind the science building, under an archway, past a row of vending machines tucked into an alcove. Avoiding the open spaces. Avoiding the crowds.

*Filing that away.*

"Alright, loan shark. Why are we meeting Gem again? She need another sample?"

"Not a swab. She wants to eyeball the resonance herself, make sure it's holding steady." Lukas steered them past the library's main entrance toward a side door. "Also, she's nosy. Humor her."

A security camera mounted above the main entrance tracked their movement. Cody caught it in his peripheral vision, the slow pan of the lens. Lukas had already steered them out of its arc.

*That's twice now. Side routes. Camera blind spots.*

Cody didn't ask. Just filed it with the rest.

"She talked plenty yesterday. Felt like she already knew my whole story before I opened my mouth."

"She's fox-quick. Reads the room before you finish sitting down." Lukas tilted his head toward the back stairs. "Special Collections. Try not to look edible."

Cody stopped walking. "Wait. Humans are eaten in this world?"

"Only in fairy tales and frat rumors." Lukas flicked an ear, amused. "Relax. Cows here run dairy co-ops, not cannibal clubs. Still, Gem's got questions. Lots of them. Be ready."

"And with that sudden confidence booster," Cody said flatly, "let's meet up with her. I'll make sure to look as inedible as possible."

"Stand up straight, look broke. Nobody eats tuition money."

"Human lost in an anthropomorphic world. Pretty sure I've got that covered."

"Broke and clueless. Perfect camouflage." Lukas nudged him up the last step. "Door on the left. Remember: short answers, don't blink first."

Special Collections smelled like dust and old paper. Gem was already there, sitting on a study ladder, her red tail swinging back and forth like a metronome. She looked up when they came in, face lighting up like she'd won a prize.

"There's my favorite interdimensional tourist." She hopped down a rung, pencil still stuck behind one ear. "Resonance is holding steady. Stronger than I expected, actually."

She dropped a small vial into Lukas's waiting paw. Silver dust swirled inside the glass. "Insurance. One pinch, one way home. Works as long as the resonance holds."

Cody watched the handoff, head doing circles. The baggage of his old world. The empty apartment. The father who didn't give a damn. The community college going nowhere. There was nothing holding him back there. And here, at least, there was something. Someone. A friend.

But a decision like this? Three days wasn't enough.

Lukas pocketed the vial, claws clicking against the glass. His eyes found Cody. "No pressure, tourist. Library's got quiet corners if you need to think."

Cody took a breath. "I'm not leaving yet. But I'm not ready to say forever either."

The words hung there.

Lukas's ears twitched. For a second, he just looked at Cody. Then he nodded slowly. "Fair. No rush."

Gem's tail flicked. She studied Cody for a moment. "Resonance is still fading slow. You've got most of the week left." She hopped down from the ladder. "Take the time, human. Just don't waste it."

She walked past them, paws quiet on the floor, and was gone before the words finished echoing.

Lukas let out a slow breath. "Week's a lot of days here. You'll know by then." He started toward the stairs. "Come on, stray. Let's feed you before you spiral."

"I'm not spiraling."

"You've got that look." Lukas glanced back. "The one where your brain's running laps. Food helps. Trust me."

Cody fell into step beside him. A week. Seven days to figure out if this world was home or just a rest stop.

He'd take it.

# Chapter 11: Rust and Secrets

They came out the library's back stairs, footsteps bouncing off stone walls older than half the campus. The stairwell was narrow, lit by fixtures that buzzed like dying flies, and it dumped them out a side door into the cold.

Late October hit like a slap. The kind of cold that found every gap in your clothes and set up camp. Cody's breath fogged in front of him as they stepped onto the main path, a wide stretch of beat-up brick cutting through the middle of campus. The quad spread out in front of them, brown and dead, crisscrossed by paths connecting the big buildings. Oak trees lined the edges, mostly bare now, a few stubborn leaves still hanging on like they hadn't gotten the memo. The ones that gave up covered the grass in soggy patches, and every few seconds the wind kicked a handful across the brick like trash in a parking lot. Students moved both ways, bundled up against the chill. A pair of rabbits hurried past with scarves wrapped up to their eyeballs, ears flat. A badger in a varsity jacket cut across the grass, leaving footprints in the frost that still clung to the shady spots. Somewhere behind them, a bell tower banged out the hour like it was mad about something.

The buildings were a mix of old and new. Library behind them, all weathered stone with dead ivy climbing the east side. Ahead, some glass and steel thing that looked like administrative offices. A figure moved past one of the upper windows, paused, seemed to look down at the quad.

Cody's pattern brain filed it. *Probably nothing.*

And past that, half-hidden by a row of evergreens, the dining hall.

"Caf's just past the quad," Lukas said, steering them onto a smaller path that curved around a fountain. The fountain was drained for the season, just a big empty bowl. "Still slinging eggs this late. And if Rumi's there, let me do the talking. He thinks humans are chew toys."

Cody followed, hands shoved in his pockets. "I'm still trying to figure out if you're telling the truth or fucking with me."

"Bit of both." Lukas flashed a fang, then dialed it back. "Keeps the blood moving. Rumi's real, and he's an ass. Stick close, mouth shut, you'll keep your skin."

"You know, humans do have a thing called overactive imaginations."

"Imagination's a luxury. Here, paranoia's survival." Lukas pushed through the cafeteria doors, and the noise hit first.

The place was loud. Conversations stacked on top of each other, mixed with clattering trays and scraping chairs. Somewhere near the back, a group busted out laughing, the sound bouncing off the high ceilings before getting swallowed by the rest of the noise. The smell came next: bacon, coffee, something sweet that might've been pancakes, all of it riding a wave of steam from the food stations. The cafeteria was bigger than Cody expected. Long tables with attached benches filled the middle, the kind you'd find in any college dining hall, scuffed and beat up from years of use. Smaller round tables with mismatched chairs sat near the windows, morning light coming through glass that needed a serious cleaning. Along the far wall, a lounge area had some beat-up couches arranged around a big flatscreen showing sports highlights. In the corner past that, an old arcade cabinet blinked and beeped to itself like it was lonely. Students filled almost every seat. Wolves and foxes, bears and rabbits, a cluster of birds at one table picking at seeds and fruit. A massive moose sat alone reading a tablet, antlers so wide Cody wondered how the hell he got through the door. Near the food line, some otters shoved each other around, laughing in high chittery voices.

Cody's eyes found the security camera in the corner. Small, mounted high, lens pointed at the main seating area. He traced its arc. Their booth would be just outside it.

*Lukas picked that spot on purpose.*

"Table by the window," Lukas said, nodding toward a corner booth half-hidden by a support column. "Sit. I'll grab trays."

Cody found the booth and slid in, pressing his back against the wall so he could see the whole room. He kept his head down but his eyes moved, taking it all in. A world of walking, talking animals eating breakfast like it was totally normal. Because for them, it was.

The smell of fresh bacon filled his nose. He tried not to think too hard about the pigs.

Lukas came back with two loaded plates and set one down in front of him. Scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, toast. Normal breakfast. Weirdly normal.

"And where is this Rumi?" Cody asked, tugging at his collar. "So I know who to avoid."

Lukas jerked his muzzle toward the far line. "Twelve o'clock. Horns first."

Cody looked. A massive bull stood near the food stations, shoulders wide enough to block a doorway, laughing loud at something one of his buddies said. A gold ring glinted in his nostril. He moved like he owned the place, and from the way everyone else gave him room, maybe he did.

"Not gonna lie," Cody muttered, "your human buddy is about to shit his pants."

Lukas slid the tray between them, blocking Cody's view of the bull. "Breathe through your mouth. He can't pick that up." His voice dropped. "You're with me, remember? My shadow's bigger than his horns."

Cody looked down at the eggs. Warm, fresh, perfectly scrambled. His stomach growled loud enough to hear. "I swear, if I stop to think about how a chicken in this world made these eggs, I'll lose my mind. But I'm hungry enough to forget for a minute."

"Chickens here unionized. Eggs come with dental." Lukas nudged the bacon closer. "Eat. Protein keeps the shakes off."

Cody grabbed a forkful of eggs and shoved it in his mouth. They tasted normal. Better than normal, actually. He was so focused on eating that he almost missed Lukas's ears swiveling, tracking something across the room.

"Finish fast," Lukas said, voice low. "Rumi's line is moving."

Cody didn't need to be told twice. He shoveled eggs into his mouth, barely chewing. If Lukas was this tense, there was a reason. He grabbed a strip of bacon and bit down.

Lukas slid his own untouched bacon onto Cody's plate. "Indigestion beats getting gored. Chew, don't inhale."

The bull's laugh got closer. Hooves on tile.

Lukas kicked Cody's shin under the table.

"Ow, fuck."

"Eyes on me." Lukas leaned in, voice a low growl. "He's three tables out. Laugh at my joke. Now."

Cody forced a grin. "Oh, haha, fuck Lukas, that's a good one."

"Keep it sloppy. Real tears help."

Lukas slung an arm over Cody's chair, blocking the view. Cody kept his head down, forcing another laugh, and heard the heavy clop of hooves pass behind him. Nostrils flared once, a snort of air, and then the sound moved on. The swing door banged shut.

Lukas let out a breath. "Breathe. You just lived through breakfast."

"Did you have to kick my shin that hard?"

"Could've bitten. Shin heals faster." Lukas nudged his leg under the table, gentler this time. "You're still sitting up, still chewing. That's a win."

Something in Lukas's jaw stayed tight even after Rumi was gone. His ears hadn't fully relaxed. Cody noticed but didn't push.

*There's history there. More than just "he's an ass."*

Cody finished the last strip of bacon and pushed his plate away. "Okay. Next stop. And I hope it doesn't have anything life-threatening attached to it."

Lukas stacked the trays. "Bleachers next. Tunnels under the stadium. Echoes like a tomb, but no horns, no crowds." His claws brushed Cody's elbow as they stood. "Just us and rust. You did good, stray. Didn't bolt, didn't puke. That's half the war."

"Took a lot of energy to not do either." Cody followed him toward the exit. "Rust I can deal with."

Outside, the late October air hit clean and sharp, smelling like dead leaves and woodsmoke from somewhere far off. The sky was pale gray, couldn't decide between clouds and sun, and a thin wind cut through Cody's borrowed shirt like it wasn't there. He shoved his hands in his pockets and wished he'd grabbed something warmer.

The campus changed as they walked. Manicured lawns gave way to wider paths lined with oaks dropping the last of their leaves. Students moved in groups, breath fogging, bundled in jackets and scarves. A few leaves skittered across the concrete like they were late for class.

Then the stadium showed up.

It sat at the edge of campus like a sleeping giant, a massive bowl of concrete and old steel that made everything else look small. The outside walls were painted in Timberwood colors, deep green and black, though the paint had faded in spots, showing the gray underneath. Banners hung between the light towers, snapping in the wind, each one showing a badger mid-snarl. A marquee near the main entrance read HOME OF THE TIMBERWOOD BADGERS in letters you could see from across the quad.

"That's... big," Cody said.

"Holds forty thousand on a good day." Lukas steered them away from the main gates, toward a service road that curved around back. "We're not going in the front. Too many eyes, too many questions."

The service road was cracked asphalt lined with chain-link fence, the kind of forgotten space behind every big building. Dumpsters in neat rows. A few maintenance carts parked near a loading dock. The pretty front face of the stadium didn't extend back here.

"Quieter back here." Lukas pulled keys from his pocket and unlocked a rusted gate set into the fence. "Tunnels smell like wet iron and old wins. Safer than the cafeteria."

They slipped through. The gate groaned shut behind them.

"Ghosts, huh?" Cody asked as they walked toward a heavy metal door in the stadium's foundation. "We talking phantom ghosts or crushed dreams?"

"Both." Lukas's voice went quieter. "This stadium's where I blew my knee sophomore year. Still hear the pop on quiet nights." He pulled the door open. Stale air rushed out, cold and damp. "Come on."

The tunnel ate them whole.

Inside, the temperature dropped like a rock. The walls were bare concrete, stained from decades of water and neglect. Pipes ran along the ceiling, some wrapped in insulation that was peeling off, others exposed and sweating. The only light came from caged bulbs spaced too far apart, throwing pools of yellow with long dark stretches in between.

Their footsteps echoed. Cody's sneakers and Lukas's boots playing a stuttered beat against the concrete floor.

Cody ducked under a low-hanging pipe. "Popped your knee. Most guys I know don't have the guts to put the helmet back on after something like that."

"Helmet stayed on. Leg didn't." Lukas tested the first rung of a service ladder bolted to the wall. It whined but held. "Coach said walk it off, so I crawled to the sideline and kept calling plays." He tapped a spot behind his fur where a scar had to be hiding. "Stubbornness gets you further than strength."

"I know that feeling," Cody said quietly.

Lukas glanced sideways, ears tilting. "Yeah? Tell me your crawl story sometime. When tunnels aren't listening." He started climbing. "Step light. Metal sings if you put too much weight on it."

The ladder led to a catwalk hanging above the main tunnel, a narrow grate walkway that swayed a little under their weight. Below, the passage stretched into black, steel support beams catching what little light made it down. The air smelled like wet iron and old concrete, with something underneath like the stadium itself was slowly rotting.

Cody grabbed the railing and tried not to look down.

"Talk normal," Lukas said as they went down a set of grated steps on the other side. "Let the dark carry it back. Tell me something the stadium hasn't heard."

Cody thought for a second. Then he cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled into the darkness.

"Nerds rule!"

The tunnel threw it back at them, a chorus of mocking echoes. NERRRDS ru-ule, ru-ule, ru-ule...

Lukas barked a laugh, ears swiveling. "Bold claim for a guy in borrowed clothes." He cuffed Cody's shoulder, claws gentle. "Stadium's keeping that one. Filed under human heresy."

"You told me to say something the stadium hadn't heard." Cody grinned. "Got you smiling, though, right?"

"Smirk counts." Lukas flicked his sleeve. "Keep talking. Dark likes new stories."

Cody paused. Then: "One time, this defensive lineman and I hooked up under the bleachers. Back home. Took everything in me not to make a sound." He shrugged. "Good thing he wasn't a very good lover."

A low whistle slipped out of Lukas, echoing dirty through the tunnel. "Stadium's blushing." He bumped Cody with a hip. "You left a ghost of your own."

"Ghosts always haunt me," Cody said, quieter now. "Just another scar on the pile."

Lukas leaned against the wall, fur brushing cold steel. "Scars stack. But you're still walking, still cracking jokes." His voice dropped. "Ghosts hate a moving target."

"Sound advice." Cody turned to face him. "What about you? Any stories for the walls?"

Lukas dragged a claw across a flaking beam, leaving a pale scratch in the rust. "Same tunnel, different year. State game, four seconds left. I told the freshman QB to audible. He froze. I got blindsided." He tapped the metal, and somewhere in the dark, an old echo answered. "Lost the ring, kept the limp. Stadium remembers the hit more than the trophy."

"Sorry it happened." Cody's voice was real. "Like I said, most guys don't pick up the helmet again after that. You're a tough wolf."

"Tough's just another word for too dumb to quit." Lukas shrugged, ears flicking. "But I still suit up. Field's the only place the knee shuts up." He looked at Cody. "You keep walking too, even with your ghosts. That's what counts."

Cody was quiet for a second. "I can't get rid of ghosts, Lukas. They like to stick around, especially at night." He swallowed. "But I'll say this. They've been quiet since I got here."

He almost said *since I met you.* But he stopped himself.

Lukas let the silence hang, just the drip of water between them.

"Then maybe the hollow's doing something right." His voice was low. "Echoes sound different when you're not the only voice."

"I've been walking the road mostly alone," Cody admitted. "Tired traveler gets tired of heavy ghosts. I guess that's one of the reasons I'm not ready to leave yet."

Lukas studied him, the tunnel light cutting across his face. "Then don't." He reached out, thumb brushing the edge of Cody's borrowed sleeve. "You're not on the road tonight. You're here. With me."

Something in Cody's chest let go. The bags under his eyes felt lighter, just for a second. It took everything in him not to break down and hug the wolf right there, but he'd only just met the guy. Instead, he gave Lukas a smile. A real one. Not armor.

"Thanks, bud. It means a lot."

Lukas swallowed, throat tight. The smile hit him different. Real.

"Don't thank me yet," he said, voice rough. "Rent's due in leftover noodles and bad jokes." He bumped Cody's shoulder, gentle. "Come on. Tunnel's heard enough secrets for one day."

# Chapter 12: New Threads

They headed back the way they came, footsteps echoing off concrete. Neither of them said much. Didn't need to. The tunnel had taken enough words for one day.

When they reached the ladder, Cody looked up at the hatch. Daylight leaked around the edges.

"Alright, tour guide," he said. "Tour's over? Ready to hit the campus store?"

"Store's upstairs in the union. They've got stuff that doesn't smell like stadium mold." Lukas started climbing the ladder, boots ringing against the rungs. "Caffeine first, shopping second. Then we figure out how to keep you from swimming in my laundry."

"Both sound great right now, bud. Need a pick-me-up after the adrenaline crash of almost getting skinned alive."

"Skin's still on. Adrenaline's just pouting." Lukas hauled him up the last step. Cold air hit them both.

Cody climbed out the hatch and tugged at his collar. The afternoon air felt warmer than the tunnels, but not by much. Late October didn't mess around. "No squeaking around a bull. Got it. Good thing I left my mousey tendencies back in my world."

"Mice don't last long here anyway." Lukas tugged his collar straight, claws catching a loose thread. "You're bigger prey now. Walk like it."

"I'd prefer to be a predator, but I get where you're going with this."

"Predator's a mindset, not a jaw size." Lukas tapped his chest with the back of his knuckles. "Square those shoulders. Quit checking exits. Own the space. Bull smells hesitation, not species."

"Stand tall?" Cody let out a breath. "Been a while since I've done that, bud."

"Yeah. Feet planted, chin up. Like you're sizing the room instead of asking permission." Lukas stepped behind him, palms flat on his shoulder blades, and pushed them back until his spine straightened. "There. Now breathe through it. Let the ribs show you're not running."

Cody planted his feet. Forced his chin up. When Lukas's palms hit his back, something clicked. Contact. Warm and deliberate. Another person actually touching him. He hadn't felt that in a couple years. With the guidance, he straightened out of his usual slump and took a deep breath of cold autumn air.

He felt different. Taller. Almost as tall as Lukas. More solid.

Lukas's hands dropped. But not immediately. They lingered for half a second before pulling away.

"Am I doing good, sensei?"

"Better. You still slouch when you breathe out. Keep the chest open on the exhale." Lukas circled him, checking the line of his posture. "And quit calling me sensei before I make you do push-ups in the quad."

"Noted. No sensei." Cody let the air out and actually smiled. Felt lighter for a second. He'd take it while it lasted. "How about chief?"

"Chief's worse. Sounds like I herd cats." Lukas flicked an ear and started walking. "Just Lukas. And yeah, you're holding it. Now walk before the posture collapses."

Cody started walking. Wasn't dragging his feet for once. Actually had a bit of pep in his step. "You should charge by the hour."

"Hourly rate's one bad joke. Already collected." Lukas kept pace, tail swaying. "Save the pep for the quad. Union's a straight shot from here."

And just like that, the moment passed. Big heart, rough exterior.

"Right behind ya, bud."

They cut across campus, Lukas steering them around the main paths again. Cody's pattern brain noted it. Third time today. Always the side routes, the covered walkways, the angles that kept them out of direct sight lines.

Halfway there, Cody spoke up.

"Hey Lukas, what did the wolf say after a fun party?"

Lukas cut him a glance, ears twitching. "Next time bring a mop." Deadpan, but the corner of his muzzle tugged. "That the punchline you wanted, or you holding out for a howl?"

"Close. He had a howling good time."

Lukas groaned, tail thumping the pavement. "That's felony wordplay. Ten yards and loss of dignity."

"And how does one lose his dignity?"

"State game, senior year. Ran the wrong route, got blindsided, helmet flew into the marching band." Lukas snorted. "Spent the next play face-down in a tuba. Highlight reel still circulates at parties."

Cody snorted. "At least it'll be remembered. Poor tuba player."

"Kid still flinches every time he hears pads hit." Lukas angled his shoulder to block a few stares from passing students. "Dignity's overrated. Scars make better stories."

"Comedy and tragedy. Both have their place."

"Comedy needs a straight man. Guess who drew the short straw."

The Student Union sat ahead, a big brick building past a row of evergreens. Students flowed in and out of the main doors, voices carrying in the cold.

"Head up," Lukas said. "Walk like you own the pavement."

They pushed through the entrance and hit the first floor. Cafeteria noise rose up around them. Trays clattering, conversations stacking, the smell of bacon and coffee and something sweet. Long tables with attached benches filled the middle of the space, scuffed from years of use. To the right, a lounge area with beat-up couches around a flatscreen showing sports highlights. An old arcade cabinet blinked in the corner. A vending machine hummed against the far wall. Cody clocked the security camera above the main entrance. Another one near the food stations. A third covering the lounge area.

*Lots of eyes in here.*

Lukas steered them toward the vending machine first, positioning them with their backs to the wall. "Caffeine, then clothes. Priorities."

He thumbed the machine. Two cups clattered down. "Sugar or black?"

"Black, bud. Like how I like my men."

Lukas choked on steam, ears flattening. "Christ. Warn a guy before you weaponize caffeine." He slid the cup over, cheeks hot under his fur.

Cody grinned and took a sip. The caffeine started kicking the crash out of his system. "Sorry. Couldn't resist."

Lukas snorted. "Gem would've said that with a straight face and then asked why my ears were doing this." He took a long sip.

"It's a shame. World needs a good laugh every now and then."

"Yeah, well. Laughs are hard to come by." Lukas crushed his cup and tossed it at the trash. Rim shot. "You've got a decent stash, though. Don't spend it all on vending sludge."

Cody chuckled. "A coffee for a joke. Fair trade."

"Store's open till four. Plenty of time." Lukas nodded toward a stairwell at the back. "Keep the jokes coming. Might need them if Rumi's prowling."

"Ah, so the bull does have a weakness. Noted, bud."

"Only weakness is volume. Dude's allergic to silence." Lukas started walking. "Mock the horns and he forgets how to charge. Just don't do it while he's within trampling range."

Cody finished his cup, tossed it, and followed. "Alright. Let's do this."

"Stick close, keep your head down. Crowd's thick and curiosity's rabid."

They climbed and stepped onto the second floor. The Timberwood University crest was set right into the floor, deep green and black, a snarling badger at the center. The store spread out beyond it, cleaner and quieter than downstairs. Racks of clothes lined the walls. Shelves of school supplies in neat rows. Banners and signage everywhere in the university colors.

Different smell up here. New clothes and paper. No food. Soft background music from somewhere.

Checkout counter right near the entrance, manned by a sleepy-looking raccoon scrolling through something on the register.

Lukas flicked through the racks and pulled out a canvas jacket in charcoal gray. Simple, no big logos, just a small Timberwood crest stitched on the chest. Earth tones. Wouldn't scream tourist.

"Try this. Hides stains and stares." He tossed it over. "Changing room's back left. Two minutes, then we're gone."

Cody caught the jacket and headed for the dressing rooms, trying not to draw attention. Couldn't tell from the pictures on the doors which was which. He picked one and shut it behind him.

The jacket fit. Not too tight, not swimming in it. The weight felt solid. Real. He ran his fingers down the front, feeling the texture. Canvas, a little rough, the kind of thing that would break in nice over time. Color was right too. Warm gray, almost brown in certain light.

His style.

He stepped out.

"What do you think, bud?"

Lukas looked him over. His eyes moved from shoulders to hem, taking in the fit. He nodded slowly.

"Fits. Like you've worn it since freshman year." He pushed off the rack he'd been leaning against. "Keep it on. Tags tuck easy." He nodded toward the registers. "Quick pay, quicker exit. Crowd's thickening downstairs."

Cody followed him to the register. The raccoon rang them up without much interest, barely glancing at his face.

Back outside, the cold hit again, but the jacket did its job. Cody could actually feel his arms.

"Thanks, bud. The moment I get any currency, you're at the top of the list."

Lukas shrugged, pocketing the receipt. "List's short. Keep it that way." Sun was lower now, chill sharpening. "Consider it rent for the couch and bad jokes."

"Aw, Lukas. Don't hurt my feelings like that."

Lukas snorted, claws clicking on the pavement. "Feelings bruise easy. Good thing you've got layers now." He bumped Cody's shoulder. "Keep cracking jokes."

"Jokes will come. I'll save the good ones."

"Smart."

Cody handed him the old borrowed shirt.

"Thanks for the loaner, bud. Now I don't have to worry about entering a Mr. Timberwood contest every time I lift my arms." He paused. "You got classes, or do you want to introduce me to your floormates? Might be awkward if a hairless ape walks in on a middle-of-the-night bathroom run."

Lukas stuffed the shirt into his pack. "Practice is at four. Plenty of time." He angled them toward the quad. "Benji and Thorne are floormates, not roommates. But they're usually in the common lounge this time of day. Thorne naps between classes. Benji games between everything."

"True, but you said humans are rare here. I want to be friendly, not gawked at. If I'm staying, might as well do it right. What's there to hide?"

Lukas slowed, ears flattening. "Not hiding. Buffering. You're raw footage. I'm giving them the edited cut." He exhaled. "Benji'll meme you in five seconds. Thorne'll hug you like a bear trap. Let me walk you in, set the tone. Then you can raid the vending machines at 3 a.m. without starting a stampede."

"See, now we're talking. Would be awkward to walk into a bathroom with one of your floormates' wang out without proper introductions."

Lukas choked on a laugh, tail lashing. "Thorne's shameless. You'll meet him in boxers eventually. Consider yourself warned."

They cut back across the quad, the late afternoon light turning everything gold and orange. The dorm building sat on the far side, five stories of weathered brick with narrow windows. Utilitarian. The kind of place that looked like it had seen things and kept quiet about them.

As they approached, Cody caught movement in a window on the third floor of the admin building across the way. A shape, there and gone. Could have been anyone.

*Or could have been watching.*

He filed it away and followed Lukas through the side door.

Inside, the air smelled like dust and cleaning products and fur. A bulletin board covered in flyers lined one wall. The elevator had an OUT OF ORDER sign that looked permanent.

"Lounge is through here." Lukas nodded toward a doorway on the right.

The common lounge was what you'd expect. Beat-up couches and armchairs arranged around a flatscreen mounted on the wall. Vending machines humming in the corner. Worn carpet that had seen better decades. A few students scattered around, mostly ignoring each other.

And there, taking up most of one couch, was a massive brown bear in a Timberwood hoodie, eyes closed, arms crossed over his chest. Next to him, a hedgehog with a gaming laptop balanced on his knees, headset on, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Lukas walked over and tapped the hedgehog's shoulder. "Benji. Pause."

The hedgehog looked up, annoyed, then saw Cody and froze.

"Thorne." Lukas nudged the bear's leg with his boot. "Wake up. Got someone you need to meet."

The bear's eyes cracked open. He looked at Cody. Blinked. Sat up slowly, the couch groaning under him.

"Handle with manners," Lukas said. "No cameras. No memes. Got it?"

Cody stepped forward. Hedgehog staring. Bear staring. The whole lounge suddenly felt very quiet.

"Erm, hi guys. Name's Cody."

---


# Chapter 13: The Raid Team

The lounge smelled like old carpet and stale coffee. A few students glanced up from their phones, then went back to ignoring the world.

Thorne's head lifted, one brown eye cracking open. "New cuddle-buddy?" he rumbled.

Benji spun in his seat, quills rattling. "Human? No way." His eyes bounced between Cody and Lukas. "For real?"

Lukas stepped between them. "Cody, meet the raid team. Guys, meet the guy who'll fry your noodles if you glitch his sleep cycle."

Cody jumped in before Lukas could say more. Play it cool. He looked at Thorne and smiled. "No cuddling here. But if you're offering, my door's open."

He glanced at the hedgehog. Fitting that a gamer was a hedgehog in this world. "And you, Sonic. You owe this hairless ape a new pair of fucking tastebuds."

Thorne's laugh shook the couch. "Bold for a two-leg. Keep talking like that, you'll earn the good blanket."

Benji yanked his headset down around his neck. "Sonic? Original. And I only torch tastebuds on Tuesdays. Today's discount day."

Lukas folded his arms, ears flicking. "See? No stampede. You're officially cleared for 3 a.m. vending runs and bathroom sprints."

Cody nodded. "Figured Lukas should introduce me before I stumble into the bathroom at 3 a.m."

Thorne snorted. "Appreciate the courtesy. Usually it's Benji barging in at zero-dark-thirty yelling about lag."

Benji flipped a middle claw without looking up from his laptop. "Stats don't lie, fur-face."

Lukas jerked his thumb toward the ceiling. "Cody's crashing on my couch upstairs. Be cool, or I'll make you both run laps in full pads."

Thorne tilted his head. "Crashing how long? We talking weekend or semester?"

"Still figuring that out," Cody said. "But I'm not going anywhere yet."

Lukas's ears pricked. "Yet's a short word. You'll know when you know."

"Beats the alternative."

Lukas tossed a throw pillow at him. "Welcome to the circus."

Cody grinned at Benji. "As long as Sonic here doesn't decide to kill me with his habanero sauce again, we're good." He glanced around the lounge. "So what do you guys do for fun around here?"

Benji snickered. "Tuesday night. Sigma Tau's basement, password's 'quills.' Bring an asbestos tongue."

Thorne stretched, claws flexing. "Or stay here, skip the jungle juice, watch me bench the fridge."

Lukas shrugged. "Your call, rookie."

"All I've got is a smart mouth and no funds. Fridge show sounds good."

Lukas arched a brow. "We'll spot you till campus payroll catches up. Consider it an advance on future bad jokes."

"Bad jokes, eh?" Cody turned to Benji. "Hey Sonic. Two toothpicks are strolling through the forest when they see a hedgehog roll by. Says one toothpick to the other: 'I didn't know there was a bus.'"

Benji groaned loud enough to rattle his headset. "Bus joke? Dude, I'm a hedgehog, not public transit."

Thorne's muzzle split in a lazy grin. "Keep firing, Cody. Eventually one'll land."

Lukas cuffed Cody's shoulder. "Save the ammo for Sigma Tau."

"Aw, come on. Just call it rent paid in advance."

"Rent accepted. Barely." Lukas flicked an ear toward the kitchenette in the corner. Microwave, mini fridge, a toaster oven that had seen better days. "Pizza rolls. Thorne's on oven duty."

Thorne pushed up from the couch, floorboards creaking. Benji muttered something about not letting the human near the hot sauce.

Cody nudged the hedgehog. "It was a pretty good prank you pulled, even if I wasn't the intended target."

Benji's spines relaxed, a tiny grin showing. "Next time I'll label the nukes. Promise."

They crowded around the kitchenette. Thorne worked the toaster oven while Lukas pulled a freezer bag from the mini fridge. Twelve minutes later, steam rose off a plate of pizza rolls, cheese bubbling at the edges.

"Grab three, blow first," Lukas said. He snagged one, pinched it between his fangs. "Or you'll torch your tongue."

"Lukas, we have pizza rolls in my world. I've eaten these by the bagful." Cody popped one in his mouth. The cheese hit like lava. "Ow, hot hot hot hot."

Lukas barked a laugh. "Told you to blow."

They ate. Thorne demolished half the plate without talking. Benji picked at his while scrolling something on his laptop. Lukas and Cody split the rest.

"Thanks, man," Cody said between bites. "For everything."

Lukas shoved the plate closer. "Don't get soppy on me. Payment's simple. Eat, don't die, keep the jokes coming."

A few minutes passed. Cody glanced at the wall clock. "Don't you and Thorne have practice soon?"

Lukas followed his gaze. 3:42. "Yeah, lift session." He stood, stretched. "Thorne's already half hibernating. I'll drag him out."

He looked at Cody. "You hang here, raid the vending machines, whatever. When we get back, we'll figure out dinner."

"Mess hall or keeping it in-house?"

Lukas's ears went flat for a half-second. "Mess hall's chili night. Hockey players arm-wrestling in the aisle and Rumi yelling about protein." He shook his head. "I vote we stay in."

*There it is again. That tension when Rumi comes up.*

Cody noted it but didn't push. "Works for me."

"When your path crosses his, it'll happen. I'll be there." Lukas tapped the armrest. "Keep your head down till then. Rumi's loud, not sharp. We'll be fine."

Cody gave him a thumbs up as he and Thorne headed for the door. "See ya later, bud."

Benji snapped his laptop shut and tucked it under his arm. "I'm out too. Got a raid in twenty and my real rig's upstairs." He pointed a claw at Cody. "Don't touch my energy drinks in the fridge. I counted them."

Lukas hooked his gym bag, tail flicking. "Later, human." He paused at the door. "If the couch eats you, scream. Thorne'll think it's cardio."

The door swung shut. Cody was alone in the lounge.

He sank into the couch, still warm from Thorne. The TV murmured sports highlights. A vending machine hummed in the corner.

Three days ago he'd been in a dead-end apartment with a father who didn't notice him. Now he had a wolf who bought him jackets, a hedgehog who'd already pranked him, and a bear who offered cuddles like handshakes.

Weird. Good weird.

He glanced at the window. Late afternoon light slanted through the blinds. Somewhere out there, the admin building loomed. Somewhere out there, someone might be watching.

*Or maybe you're just paranoid.*

He grabbed the remote and turned up the volume on the game.

---


# Chapter 14: The Strain

The game on TV went to halftime. Cody didn't remember who was playing.

He'd been staring at the screen for an hour, maybe longer, letting the noise fill the empty lounge. A few students had drifted in and out, grabbing snacks from the vending machines, but none of them sat down. The hairless ape in the corner was apparently enough to keep the couches clear.

Fine by him. He wasn't in the mood to explain himself anyway.

His phone buzzed. Lukas's number.

*Practice running late. Rumi being Rumi. Back in 30.*

Cody typed back: *No rush. Couch hasn't eaten me yet.*

He pocketed the phone and sank deeper into the cushions. The light through the blinds had shifted from gold to gray. Evening coming on fast. That was the second time today Lukas had mentioned the bull without actually saying anything. The flat ears. The clipped sentences. The way he'd steered them around the cafeteria like he was avoiding a landmine. There's history there. More than just locker room rivalry. Cody filed it away with the rest. Camera blind spots. Side routes. The way Lukas's ears never quite relaxed when Rumi's name came up. Patterns. Always patterns.

---

Lukas came through forty minutes later.

Cody clocked him immediately. The gait was wrong. Lukas usually moved like he owned whatever room he walked into, shoulders loose, tail swaying. Not now. Now his steps were tight, his tail hung low, barely moving. Gym bag over one shoulder, fur matted with sweat from practice. Thorne lumbered behind him, hood up, taped knuckles flexing.

*Something happened.*

Cody sat up. Thorne's shoulders were tight too. His eyes flicked to Cody, then away. Warning.

"Hey," Cody said. "How was practice?"

Lukas dropped his bag on the floor. Didn't look at him. "Fine."

One word. Clipped. The kind of "fine" that meant the opposite.

Thorne caught Cody's eye and gave a small shake of his head. *Don't push.*

Cody pushed anyway. "You said Rumi was being Rumi. What happened?"

Lukas's ears flattened. "Nothing."

"Didn't sound like nothing."

"Drop it."

The words came out harder than anything Lukas had said to him before. Quiet and cold. Like a door slamming shut.

Cody felt the temperature in the room change. Thorne shifted his weight, uncomfortable.

"Okay," Cody said slowly. "I was just asking."

Lukas finally looked at him. His eyes were different. Distant. Guarded in a way they hadn't been since the first night.

"You've been here three days," Lukas said. "You don't know anything about this place. About him. About any of it." He grabbed his bag again. "So maybe stop asking questions you can't understand the answers to."

The words landed like a slap.

A spark caught somewhere deep. The kind that used to get him in trouble. The kind that felt good for three seconds and cost him everything. His jaw clenched, pressure coiling tight behind his ribs.

He swallowed it. Shoved it down like he always did. But it felt heavier this time. Harder to cage. His hands were shaking, and not from fear.

Three days. That was all he was. A tourist. A stray. Someone who didn't belong and never would.

He'd known it, somewhere in the back of his head. But hearing Lukas say it out loud was different.

Something behind his ribs wanted him to stand up, get loud, make this hurt the way it was hurting him.

Cody took a breath. Held it. Let it out slow.

"Got it." The word scraped out. Flat because he made it flat. "Sorry for asking."

Lukas's muzzle went tight. For a second, something flickered in his eyes. Regret, maybe. But he didn't take it back.

"I need to shower," he said. "Thorne, you good?"

Thorne nodded slowly, eyes still on Cody. "Yeah. Go ahead."

Lukas disappeared up the stairs without another word.

The lounge got very quiet.

---

Thorne settled onto the couch across from Cody, the frame groaning under his weight. He didn't say anything for a long moment. Just sat there, watching Cody with those calm brown eyes.

"He didn't mean it," Thorne said finally. His voice was low, steady. "Rumi gets under his skin. Always has."

"I noticed." Cody stared at the TV, not really seeing it. "Doesn't matter."

"It matters." Thorne leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "Lukas doesn't snap like that. Not at people he cares about."

"Maybe he doesn't care as much as you think."

The words came out before Cody could stop them. Bitter. Defensive. The old walls going back up, brick by brick.

*A week.* That's what Gem said. A week before the resonance faded. He could still leave. Find Gem, get another pinch of that silver dust, and be back in his dead-end apartment by morning.

*Home.* The word tasted like a joke. Back to the father who wouldn't notice he'd been gone. Back to being invisible.

But at least invisible didn't hurt like this.

*Three days.* He'd let himself hope in three days. Stupid. He knew better. People always showed you who they really were eventually. You just had to wait long enough.

Thorne was quiet for a beat. Then he stood up. "Stay here. I'm going to get Gem."

His footsteps faded down the hall. Cody was alone again.

---

Gem showed up ten minutes later, mechanical pencil tucked behind one ear, tail flicking with that sharp, assessing energy Cody was starting to recognize.

She stayed standing, looking at him.

"Thorne said there was a situation."

"There's no situation." Cody kept his eyes on the TV. "Lukas had a bad day. I asked the wrong question. End of story."

Gem's ears twitched. She walked over and sat on the arm of the couch, close enough that her tail brushed his shoulder.

"What did he say?"

"Nothing."

"Cody."

Something in her voice made him look up. She wasn't pushing. She was just... there. Waiting.

"He said I've been here three days." Cody's teeth pressed together. "That I don't know anything about this place. About Rumi. About any of it."

Gem's pencil started tapping against her knee. "And that hurt."

"It's true." Cody shrugged, aiming for casual and missing by a mile. "I am a tourist. I don't know anything. I'm just some stray he picked up because he felt sorry for me."

"Is that what you think?"

"It's what he said."

Gem was quiet for a moment. Her tail had gone still.

"Lukas and Rumi were best friends," she said. "Since they were six years old."

Cody blinked. That wasn't what he'd expected.

"What?"

"Grew up on the same street. Played on the same peewee teams. Lukas was the quiet one, Rumi was the loud one. They balanced each other out." Gem's voice was matter-of-fact, but there was something underneath it. "Came to Timberwood together. Freshman year, they were inseparable."

"What happened?"

"Rumi happened." Gem's pencil stopped tapping. "He got popular. Got recruited by the right crowds. Started caring more about status than... anything else. Lukas didn't fit the image anymore. Too quiet. Too steady. Not flashy enough."

Cody felt something shift in his chest. "Rumi ditched him."

"Worse. He pretended they'd never been close. Started calling him 'that wolf from back home' like they were casual acquaintances instead of brothers." Gem's ears flattened slightly. "Lukas doesn't talk about it. Ever. But it broke something in him."

The lounge felt smaller suddenly. The TV noise faded to static.

"So when Rumi gets under his skin..."

"He lashes out at whoever's closest." Gem looked at him. "Not because he means it. Because it's the only way he knows how to handle the hurt."

Cody was quiet for a long moment. The anger he'd been nursing started to drain away, replaced by something heavier.

"I've seen what happens when you don't catch things in time," Gem said, her voice dropping. "People drift. Wounds fester. By the time you notice, it's too late to fix. Don't let this be one of those times."

She stood up to leave, then paused.

"He'll come find you. Give him twenty minutes to stop being an idiot."

Her footsteps faded toward the stairs.

---

Lukas came down eighteen minutes later.

Cody was still on the couch, staring at the TV without seeing it. He heard the footsteps on the stairs, the hesitation at the bottom, the slow approach across the worn carpet.

Lukas stopped a few feet away. His fur was dry now, clothes changed, but his ears were still flat against his skull.

"Can I sit?"

Cody just shrugged. Didn't look at him.

Lukas winced at that. He sat down anyway, leaving space between them.

For a long moment, neither of them said anything. The TV droned on. Some commercial about car insurance.

"I was wrong," Lukas said finally. His voice was rough. "What I said. All of it."

Cody didn't respond.

"Rumi got in my head at practice. Said some things." Lukas's claws dug into the armrest. "About you. About me picking up strays for attention. About how I always need someone to fix so I feel important."

The words hung there.

"And you believed him?"

"No." Lukas exhaled hard. "But he knows where to hit. He always has." He turned to look at Cody, and his eyes were different now. Open. Vulnerable in a way Cody hadn't seen before. "We grew up together. Best friends since we were six. I thought he'd be my brother forever."

"Gem told me."

Lukas nodded slowly. "Then you know. He chose status over me. Over everything we had." His voice cracked slightly. "And I've never... I don't know how to talk about it. So when he pokes at it, I just... shut down. Push people away before they can do what he did."

Cody finally looked at him. Really looked.

The big wolf linebacker. The guy who'd bought him a jacket and fought off stares and made sure he had a place to sleep. Sitting there with his tail tucked and his ears flat, looking like a kid who'd just lost his best friend all over again.

Part of Cody wanted to let him sit there. Let him stew. See how it felt to be the one hurting for once.

The thing behind his ribs liked that idea.

But Lukas wasn't his father. Wasn't the friends who'd ghosted him after the assault. He was just a guy who'd been cut open by someone he thought would always have his back, and bled on the nearest person.

Cody knew what that felt like.

"You're not pushing me away," he said. The words scraped out, rough and reluctant. "I'm still here."

Lukas's breath caught. For a long moment he didn't say anything.

"I'm sorry." His voice broke on it. "I didn't mean any of it. You're not just some tourist. You're not a stray I picked up out of pity." He swallowed hard, claws digging into his own knee. "You're... you matter. Okay? You matter to me."

The thing behind Cody's ribs wanted to call bullshit. Wanted to push back, test it, make Lukas prove it.

He didn't.

"I know what it's like," Cody said. Each word a small surrender. "I had a best friend too. Only one." He finally met Lukas's eyes. "Something happened. Something I did. And after that, he pretended I didn't exist. Like we'd never known each other." He swallowed. "Everyone else I understood. But him? That one broke something. So yeah. I get it. Doesn't mean it didn't hurt."

"I know." Lukas's voice was barely above a whisper. "I know it hurt."

Silence. The TV murmured in the background, neither of them listening.

"Something you did?" Lukas's voice was careful. Leaving the door open.

Cody opened his mouth to deflect. To change the subject. To shove it back down where it couldn't breathe.

But he was tired. So tired of carrying it alone.

"Yeah." His voice came out rough. "Something I did. And I lost everything because of it." He blinked hard, swallowing against the tightness in his throat. "I'm not ready to talk about it. But... yeah. It's there."

Lukas was quiet for a moment. Then he shifted closer on the couch. Close enough to matter. His paw found Cody's shoulder. Heavy. Deliberate.

"I don't need the details," Lukas said. "I just need you to know something." He waited until Cody looked at him. "Whatever you did? It doesn't change anything. Not for me."

Cody's throat tightened.

"You don't even know what it was."

"Don't have to." Lukas held his gaze. "I know who you are now. That's enough."

Something cracked in Cody's chest. Not the rage this time. Something older. Heavier. The grief he'd been dragging behind him like a chain for years.

He let it pass through instead of shoving it down. Just this once.

It hurt. But it was a clean kind of hurt. The kind that meant something was healing instead of festering.

"We're both kind of messed up, huh?" Lukas said.

"Probably." The corner of Cody's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. Not yet. "But at least we're messed up together."

Something in the room shifted. Still fragile. But enough.

Lukas's tail gave a small wag. Just once.

"Dinner?" he asked. "Thorne's ordering pizza. Extra cheese. My treat."

"You already bought me a jacket."

"I'll put it on your tab." Lukas squeezed his shoulder, then let go. "Come on, stray. Let's go be messed up with the rest of the pack."

Cody stood up. The thing behind his ribs had finally gone quiet. Settled, like a dog that had been given a place by the fire.

That was new.

"Lead the way, wolfy."

The nickname landed before he'd thought about it. But he didn't take it back. Lukas's ears perked up, something warm flickering behind the exhaustion.

"Wolfy?"

"You got a problem with it?"

"Nah." Lukas bumped his shoulder as they headed for the stairs. "I've had worse."

They climbed in comfortable silence, the TV fading behind them. Cody's hands had stopped shaking. His chest didn't feel like a bomb anymore.

Three days ago, he would've walked out that door and never looked back. That was the pattern. Someone hurts you, you leave before they can do it again. Protect yourself. Stay small. Stay gone.

But he hadn't left. He'd stayed. And Lukas had come back.

Maybe that was what mattered. Not the wound. The repair.

He was still figuring out if this place was home. But for the first time, he wanted to find out.

## MEMORANDUM: OFFICE OF THE DEAN
### TIMBERWOOD HOLLOW UNIVERSITY
### CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED — ADMINISTRATIVE EYES ONLY

• • •

**DATE:** [CURRENT: Day 3 of Subject Presence]

**RE:** Anomaly Incident Report TH-2024-001: Preliminary Assessment and Acquisition Recommendation

**FROM:** V. Graves, Dean of Academic Affairs

**TO:** [REDACTED: Security Division]

• • •

**SUMMARY:**

Resonance signature detected approximately 48 hours ago in the northeast pine grove, approximately 200 meters from the athletic complex. Pattern consistent with Class-IV dimensional transit: full biological transfer, intact consciousness, stable vitalization. Campus security confirmed visual: human, male, early twenties, no visible trauma.

This is the first viable acquisition opportunity Timberwood has documented in fourteen years.

**SUBJECT PROFILE:**

- **Designation:** TH-2024-001
- **Species:** Human (Homo sapiens): CONFIRMED
- **Estimated Age:** 19-22
- **Physical Condition:** Ambulatory, alert, no apparent degradation
- **Portal Resonance:** Active (see attached spectral analysis)
- **Current Status:** Uncontained. Integrated with student population.

**OBSERVATIONS:**

Subject has been observed in the company of Lukas Raines (Senior, Athletic Scholarship, Football). Raines appears to have assumed a protective role. Motivation unclear. No prior connection to dimensional research. No known personal stake. Continued observation authorized.

Subject has not attended classes, has not registered, and does not appear in any institutional database. He is, for all administrative purposes, a ghost.

Resonance readings remain anomalously stable. Unlike previous subjects, decay has not followed expected degradation curves. This warrants immediate investigation — the window will not remain open indefinitely. Once resonance fades to baseline, subject becomes significantly less valuable for longitudinal frequency mapping.

**RECOMMENDATION:**

Immediate retrieval and transfer to Sublevel Research Wing for preliminary examination. Full workup to include:

- Comprehensive biological sampling (tissue, marrow, cerebrospinal fluid)
- Resonance field documentation under controlled conditions
- Psychological intake and cognitive baseline
- Long-term observation protocols (minimum 6-month commitment recommended)

I am aware that retrieval presents logistical complications given subject's integration with the student body. However, I must stress: opportunities of this nature do not recur on convenient timelines. The last comparable subject (TH-2010-003) expired during transit before any meaningful data could be collected. The one before that (TH-1996-017) was claimed by Hartwell Institute within 48 hours of manifestation.

Timberwood has waited long enough.

I have authorized discreet surveillance. I am also making contact with assets within the athletic program who may prove useful in facilitating a quiet transfer.

This matter should be resolved before Friday's game. Public events create complications.

Further updates to follow.

# Chapter 15: The Open Door


Cody woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of the closet door sliding open.

He lay still for a moment, letting the room come into focus. Pale light through the blinds, the fold-out couch springs digging into his back in the same places they always did, water running through pipes somewhere down the hall.

Last night kept surfacing. The fight. The way Lukas had come back down the stairs, ears flat, tail tucked. *You matter to me.* The words had landed somewhere deep, in a place Cody didn't let people reach. He still wasn't sure what to do with them.

He turned his head. Lukas was pulling a practice jersey from the closet, already dressed from the waist down. His fur caught the morning light, silver streaks threading through the darker coat. When he moved, there was that easy looseness in his shoulders again. Whatever broke last night had started to mend.

"Hey." Cody's voice came out rough. "What time is it?"

Lukas glanced over. Something flickered in his expression, almost a smile. "Little after eight. Practice in forty, so I gotta run soon." He pulled the jersey over his head, tugging it down over his chest. The fabric stretched tight across his shoulders. Cody looked away, suddenly very interested in the ceiling.

"How you feeling? You were out cold when I got up. Thought you might actually be dead."

"Fine." Cody pushed himself up, the couch frame groaning. "Slept okay."

"Liar. That couch is a torture device." Lukas crossed to the kitchenette and poured two cups of coffee. He slid one toward the edge of the counter, same spot he always did. "Black, strong enough to strip paint. The Cody Guiles special."

Cody took it. The mug was warm in his hands. "You memorized my coffee order."

"You've been here four days. Doesn't take a genius to notice." Lukas leaned against the counter, watching him over the rim of his own mug. His tail swayed once, low and easy.

The silence stretched, comfortable but full of something unspoken. Something had shifted between them. Cody could feel it, even if he couldn't name it. The air was different, charged in a way it hadn't been before last night. He didn't know if Lukas felt it too, or if this was just him, reading patterns that weren't there. He took a sip of coffee to avoid saying something stupid.

Lukas set his mug down and grabbed his gym bag from the floor. "Film review first, then drills. Coach wants us sharp for Saturday."

"Big game?"

"Rivalry game. Rumi's been running his mouth all week." The name landed flat. His jaw didn't tighten the way it had yesterday, and Cody filed that away as progress. "Should be back by eleven." He slung the bag over his shoulder and stopped at the door, paw resting on the frame. He didn't turn around. "Stay put, okay?"

*Stay safe. Stay hidden. Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.*

"Yeah," Cody said. "I'll be here."

Lukas nodded once. Then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

---

An hour later, the room felt different without Lukas in it.

Cody stood by the window, watching the quad three stories below. Students crossed in pairs and clusters, breath fogging in the morning chill, leaves skittering across the brick paths. Normal life. The kind he used to have.

*Stay put.* The words kept circling back. Like a dog waiting for its owner.

Cody pushed the thought away. Lukas didn't mean it like that. He was just being careful. They were all being careful, all the time, and Cody was grateful for it. He was. The walls of the room pressed in. The fold-out couch where he slept, the gaming setup he didn't touch, the trophies on the shelf he tried not to look at. All of it Lukas's. None of it his. He needed air. Or at least a different set of walls.

Cody grabbed his jacket from the back of the couch, the charcoal canvas one with the Timberwood crest, and headed for the door. The common lounge downstairs had vending machines, a TV, couches that weren't his borrowed bed. It was something. He pulled the door open and stepped into the hallway. The carpet was worn down the middle, a path of footsteps from years of students trudging to class. He passed Thorne's door, then Benji's, then hit the stairwell.

Halfway down the second flight, footsteps came up from below.

A raccoon in a campus polo rounded the landing, clipboard tucked under one arm. Student worker, probably. The kind of kid who signed up for work-study because the alternative was asking parents for money. The raccoon looked up, saw Cody, and stopped.

"Oh. You're the one." He scanned Cody like he was checking a box. "Human, right? Staying with Raines?"

Cody's stomach dropped. He wasn't supposed to exist. Not officially. "Who's asking?"

The raccoon shrugged. "Got a delivery. Admin sent me to Westfall, third floor, looking for the human." He held out a folded piece of paper. "Guess I found you."

Cody took it. The paper was heavy, the kind they used for official university stuff. A crest was embossed at the top. "Thanks," he said, but the raccoon was already leaving, door swinging shut behind him.

Cody turned the paper over. No envelope. Just folded once, nothing written on the outside. He unfolded it.

---

*Cody,*

*I understand you've had an unusual introduction to our campus. I imagine the past few days have been disorienting, perhaps frightening. That's understandable.*

*I'd like to offer some clarity about your situation, if you're willing. My door is open this morning. No pressure, no obligations. Just a conversation between two people who might benefit from understanding each other.*

*You deserve answers. I may have some.*

*Warm regards,*
*V. Graves*
*Dean of Academic Affairs*
*Office 412*

---

Cody read it twice. Then a third time. His name. Just his first name, but still. How did the Dean of Academic Affairs know his name?

He leaned against the stairwell wall, the note heavy in his hands. His first instinct was to wait for Lukas. Show him the note, let him decide what to do. That was the safe play. That was what Lukas would want. But Lukas would say no. Lukas always said no. Every path they walked was chosen to avoid something. Every decision was made for Cody, not with him. He thought about the past few days. The side routes. The camera blind spots. The way Lukas checked his phone and didn't explain, the way Gem talked about him like he was a problem to be solved, the way everyone whispered when they thought he wasn't listening. They were protecting him. He knew that. But when was the last time anyone asked what HE wanted?

*Just a conversation.* This could be a trap. Obviously it could be a trap. But it could also be information. Intel. The thing you gathered before you made a move, not after.

Cody pushed off the wall. His legs felt steadier than he expected. He headed for the door.

---

The walk across campus felt different alone.

For three days, Lukas had been a wall between Cody and everything else. A warm wall, a protective wall, but still a wall. Now there was nothing between Cody and the morning air, the students cutting across the quad, the buildings that had only ever been backdrop. He took the main path. The one Lukas always avoided.

It cut past the science building, the one with the double helix sculpture out front. Stainless steel, taller than Lukas, catching the morning light in a way that made it hard to look at directly. The building itself was brick, darker than the rest of campus, six stories when everything else topped out at four. Wide glass doors showed a lobby that always seemed empty no matter what time of day it was. Cody had seen it a dozen times from a distance. Up close, it should have looked like just another building. Students sat on the concrete planters out front, coffee cups in hand, textbooks open on their laps. But none of them were facing the doors. They sat with their backs to the glass, angled toward the quad, like they'd chosen the spot for the sun and nothing else. Cody kept walking. Maybe Lukas was paranoid. Maybe they all were. But he walked a little faster anyway.

The admin building sat at the north edge of the quad, brick and ivy, older than most of the campus. Cody pushed through the main doors and the smell hit him first: floor wax and old paper and that particular staleness of places where important things got decided by people who never had to stand. The directory by the elevator said Office of Academic Affairs was on the fourth floor. He pressed the button and waited.

The elevator was slow and old, the kind that made you think about fraying cables, skipped inspections, the last time anyone bothered to check. Cody watched the numbers climb: 2, 3, 4. The doors opened with a sound like a sigh. The hallway was carpeted, muted, the kind of quiet that made you want to whisper. Doors lined both sides, nameplates in brass. Most were closed. At the far end, one stood slightly open. The brass plate caught the light:

**412**
**VICTOR GRAVES, Ph.D.**
**Dean of Academic Affairs**

Cody walked toward it. His footsteps didn't make any sound on the carpet, which felt wrong somehow, like the building was swallowing evidence of his presence. He stopped outside the door. Through the gap, he could see the edge of a window, daylight spilling across a wooden floor. He knocked.

"Come in." The voice was soft, warm even, the kind that made you think of guidance counselors and family doctors.

Cody pushed the door open.

---

The light hit him first. Floor-to-ceiling windows lined the back wall, the whole campus spread out below like a postcard. Morning sun poured in, catching dust motes, making the room feel bigger than it probably was. A view for important people doing important things.

Then the photos. They were everywhere. Framed shots on the walls, on the desk, on the bookshelf behind it. A silver-furred lynx with kind eyes, standing next to Graves at what looked like a faculty party. Two young snow leopards in graduation robes, grinning at the camera. A family vacation shot, everyone smiling, mountains in the background. More photos lined the walls: Graves shaking hands with someone official, Graves cutting a ribbon in front of a building, Graves at a podium receiving an award. A framed thank-you card covered in student signatures. A crayon drawing taped to the side of the bookshelf, the kind a little kid makes when they're proud of something. The desk was mahogany, worn smooth in the spot where paws would rest. A mug sat near the edge: "World's Okayest Dean." A bowl of wrapped candies caught the light.

And in the middle of all of it, rising from a leather chair, was the snow leopard from the photos. He was taller than Cody expected. Lean, silver-white fur with dark spots that had faded to gray at the edges. Pale blue eyes that seemed to take in everything without moving. He wore a charcoal suit, perfectly fitted, a navy tie, a watch that probably cost more than Cody's dad made in a month.

"Cody." The voice matched the note, quiet and unhurried. "Thank you for coming. Please, have a seat." He gestured to one of the chairs facing the desk. Leather, well-worn, positioned so the window was behind them. Cody would be backlit. Graves would see every expression on his face. He sat down anyway.

"Can I offer you something? Water? Coffee?" Graves nodded toward the candy bowl. "These are actually quite good. Butterscotch. My weakness."

"I'm fine."

"Suit yourself." Graves took one himself, unwrapping it with the casual ease of someone who'd done it a thousand times. He popped it in his mouth, crumpled the wrapper, dropped it in a small trash can by the desk. "There. Now you know I'm not trying to poison you." Cody didn't laugh. Graves didn't seem to expect him to. The snow leopard settled back in his chair, paws folded on the desk. His expression could have been curiosity or patience. Hard to tell.

"You know, I realized I don't even know your full name."

Cody's hands went still in his lap. His real name. The one on the police report and the local news segment and the scholarship that got revoked. The name the whole town learned to say with a certain tone. He could lie. Make something up. Lukas would probably tell him to. But Lukas wasn't here. And wasn't that the whole point? Making his own choices?

"Guiles."

"Guiles," Graves repeated, nodding once. He didn't reach for a pen or paper. The name just disappeared somewhere behind those pale blue eyes. "Thank you, Cody. I imagine you've heard things about me. About the administration. About what we might want from someone in your situation."

Cody didn't answer. His eyes drifted to the family photos on the desk. The wife, the kids. The frames looked old. Dusty on top, like they hadn't been moved in years.

"I won't pretend those concerns are baseless," Graves continued. "There are people in any institution who see anomalies as opportunities. Research subjects. Data points. I've worked with some of them. I know the type." He paused, letting that land. "But I'm not one of them. And I'm not interested in treating you like a specimen."

"What are you interested in?"

The question came out sharper than Cody meant it to. Graves didn't flinch. If anything, his expression warmed. "You," he said simply. "Your experience. Your survival." He leaned forward slightly, paws still folded. "Do you understand how remarkable you are, Cody? Cross-dimensional transit has a mortality rate we don't discuss publicly. The stress on biological systems, the cellular disruption, the neurological trauma... most arrivals don't survive the crossing. The ones who do are often... damaged. Permanently."

Cody's throat tightened. He thought about the white void. The way reality had folded in on itself. The black that came after.

"You walked through something that should have killed you," Graves said. "And you came out the other side intact. Healthy. Functional. That's not luck. That's something else entirely."

"Something you want to study."

"Something I want to understand." Graves spread his paws, a gesture of openness. "This isn't about locking you in a cage or running tests in some basement. I'm talking about learning what made you different. Documenting it. And potentially helping the next person who falls through." The next person. Cody hadn't thought about that. The idea that there might be others, falling through portals, dying in transit, alone and scared and with no one to catch them on the other side.

"What if what's in your biology could save someone?" Graves asked. "What if understanding your survival could make the difference for a kid like you, five years from now, who doesn't have a Lukas Raines waiting in a pine grove?"

The name landed like a stone in still water. "You know Lukas."

"I know everyone on my campus, Cody." The first name again. Friendly. Familiar. Like they'd known each other for years instead of minutes. "He's a good young man. Protective. Loyal. The kind of person who sees someone in trouble and acts without thinking about consequences." He paused. "Which is admirable. But not always wise."

The wrong details kept surfacing. The photos that were too old. The candy bowl that was too full. The way Graves controlled the light, the seating, the rhythm of the conversation. The way he used Cody's name like they were friends. But nothing he was saying was wrong. That was the problem. Nothing was a lie.

"Your friends care about you," Graves said. "That's obvious. But I wonder sometimes..." He let the sentence hang.

"Wonder what?"

"Whether they're protecting you. Or whether they're keeping you scared."

The words hit somewhere Cody didn't expect. Somewhere soft. "There's a difference," Graves continued, "between helping someone and making them dependent. Between keeping someone safe and keeping them small. I've seen it before. Good intentions calcifying into control. The person being protected loses their agency so gradually they don't even notice it's gone."

Cody thought about the side routes. The blind spots. The way Lukas decided where they walked, when they ate, who they talked to. The way every choice was made FOR him.

"When's the last time you decided something for yourself?" Graves asked. "Where to go. What to do. Who to speak with." The question sat in the air like smoke.

"I decided to come here," Cody said.

Graves smiled. It was a small smile, almost sad. "Yes. You did. And I suspect that wasn't easy." He was right. It hadn't been.

"You seem like someone who's used to taking care of himself," Graves said. "Someone who's had to. Because no one else would."

Cody went still.

"I recognize the look," Graves said, voice low. "I was that young man once. Capable. Determined. Surrounded by people who meant well but couldn't stop treating me like a problem to be managed. Who couldn't see that I didn't need protection. I needed trust." The words settled into Cody's chest like sand filling a hole. How did he know? How could he possibly know?

"It's exhausting," Graves said. "Being protected by people who won't let you protect yourself. Being helped by people who don't trust you to help them back. You start to wonder if you're actually the person they see, or if you're just their idea of who you should be."

Cody didn't answer. Couldn't.

Graves let the silence stretch. Then he stood, and the conversation was over. Just like that. He was in control of when it ended, and he'd decided it ended now. "I'm not asking you to decide anything today," he said. "I'm not asking you to trust me, or agree with me, or do anything at all." He walked around the desk, slowly, giving Cody space. "I just wanted you to know that my door is open. If you want answers, real answers, not filtered through people who've already decided what's best for you... you know where to find me."

He stopped a few feet away. The light from the window fell across his face, and for a moment Cody saw something underneath the warmth. Something patient. Something that had been waiting a very long time.

"Think about it," Graves said. "That's all I ask."

---

The hallway felt longer on the way out. Cody walked past the brass nameplates, the closed doors, the carpet that swallowed his footsteps. The elevator took forever. The lobby smelled like floor wax and paper and something else now, something he couldn't name.

Outside, the campus looked exactly the same. Students crossing the quad. Someone laughing near the fountain. The science building's helix sculpture caught the midmorning light, throwing a glare across the brick. The lobby behind those glass doors was still empty, but that didn't seem strange anymore. Lots of buildings had empty lobbies.

But Cody wasn't seeing it the same way.

He replayed the conversation in his head. The photos, the candy, the way Graves had controlled everything without ever raising his voice. The way he'd known exactly which buttons to push. *Someone who's used to taking care of himself. Because no one else would.* It wasn't wrong. That was the thing. None of it was wrong. Lukas did make all the decisions. Gem did talk about him like a problem. Everyone did whisper when they thought he wasn't listening. But they were protecting him. Weren't they?

He thought about telling Lukas. Showing him the note, explaining where he'd been, letting him decide what it meant. But Lukas would be angry. Lukas would say he'd been stupid, reckless, that he should have waited, should have trusted them, should have stayed put like a good little"”

Cody stopped walking. His hands had curled into fists without him noticing. There was heat in his knuckles, tight and sharp, like his body was getting ready for something his brain hadn't agreed to yet. He uncurled them. Breathed. He was doing it again. Running every decision through what Lukas would think. What Lukas would want. What Lukas would decide. *When's the last time YOU decided something?*

He folded the note and put it in his pocket. He'd think about it. That was all. Just think. The morning sun was warm on his face as he walked back toward the dorm. Somewhere behind him, a clock tower chimed ten. He had an hour before Lukas got back. An hour to figure out what any of this meant. An hour to decide if the doubt taking root in his chest was wisdom or poison. He didn't know yet.

But he was starting to wonder.

---

# Chapter 16: Teeth and Trust


The door opened at eleven on the dot. Lukas filled the frame, gym bag over one shoulder, practice jersey dark with sweat. His fur was damp at the edges, ears still flattened from the helmet. He looked tired, but something in his posture loosened when he saw Cody sitting on the couch.

"Hey." He dropped the bag by the closet. "You stayed."

"Said I would." Cody kept his eyes on the window.

Lukas crossed to the kitchenette and ran water over his paws, scrubbing off the grass and chalk. "Practice was brutal. Rumi's got everyone wound tight for Friday." He shook his paws dry, grabbed a towel. "You eat anything?"

"Wasn't hungry." His stomach had been in knots since Whitmore Hall.

Lukas paused. His eyes found Cody's face, and Cody felt the weight of that look. Reading him. The way he always did. "You okay?"

"Fine." The word came out too fast. Cody made himself shrug. "Just bored. Walls start pressing in after a while." Lukas studied him for another beat, then nodded, accepting it, and something in Cody's chest twisted. It was that easy to lie to him. That easy to hide.

"Got an idea." Lukas crossed to the closet and pulled out a beat-up football, spinning it once on his claws. "There's a tunnel under the practice field. Storage space, mostly. Rusted hatch, no cameras. We're going."

Not *want to go?* Not *what do you think?* Just: we're going. *When's the last time YOU decided something?*

"You played in high school, right?" Lukas asked. "Captain?"

"Running back. Three seasons." Cody watched the ball spin. He hadn't touched a football since the day everything fell apart.

"Good." Lukas tossed the ball from paw to paw. "Dark enough to disappear in. Thought we could use it."

*No cameras.* The phrase caught somewhere in Cody's head. A week ago, it would have sounded like safety. Now it sounded like something else. Isolation. Somewhere no one would see. He pushed the thought down. This was Lukas. The same Lukas who'd pulled him out of a pine grove, bought him a jacket, told him he mattered. But the doubt was there now, curled up in his chest like a stone, and he couldn't make it go away.

Cody stood, legs heavier than they should have been. "Sure. Let's go."

---

The hatch was fifty yards past the goalpost, rusted metal set into the grass like a scar. Lukas popped the padlock with a claw. The hinges groaned as he lifted it, revealing nothing but black underneath.

"Get in. I'll keep the light off until we hit the bottom."

Cody peered into the dark. "You know humans can't see in the dark, right?"

"I know." Lukas's voice softened. "Stay close. I won't let you trip."

He dropped into the tunnel first, boots ringing on metal. Cody followed, feeling his way down the ladder, the rungs cold and rough under his palms. The smell rose to meet him halfway down. Rust, damp concrete, something older underneath, like the crawlspace under his grandmother's house where he used to hide when things got loud upstairs. His borrowed shoes hit the floor with a clang that echoed too long. Somewhere ahead, water dripped in a slow rhythm, each drop landing with a small plunk that made the silence feel bigger.

Lukas thumbed his phone to life. A thin blue glow cut the shadows, just enough to see shapes. The tunnel stretched ahead of them, rebar ribs curving overhead like the inside of some giant's throat. The ceiling hung low enough that Lukas had to duck his ears. Condensation slicked the walls, catching the phone's glow in thin streaks.

"Teeth and trust," Lukas said, voice low. "That's all that matters down here." He rolled the football across his claws, then tossed it underhand. It landed at Cody's feet with a soft thud. "Pick it up. Toss it back when you're ready."

Cody picked up the ball. The laces felt familiar under his fingers, muscle memory stirring even after all these years. He hadn't wanted to remember how this felt. How natural. How easy. He stepped back a few feet, let his wrist flick on the release.

The ball cut through the dark. A soft thwap of leather hitting palm, then Lukas's voice: "Not bad for a guy who hasn't played since high school." He lofted it back, soft spiral. "Again. Loosen your wrist a little more. Let the ball do the work."

They fell into a rhythm. Each throw took Cody a little deeper into the tunnel, a little further from the phone's glow.

"Keep stepping back. I'll track your voice."

Cody backed up until he could barely see his own hands. The darkness was total now, thick enough to swallow everything. He could hear Lukas somewhere ahead, boots scuffing, breath steady. *Teeth and trust.* Cody turned the phrase over in his head. He wound up and threw harder, feeling the snap of his wrist. "Fetch."

The ball whistled through the black. A beat of silence. Then the soft pop of a clean catch, and Lukas's laugh echoed off the walls. "Good boy. Now let's see what you can handle."

The next ball came fast and low, whispering past Cody's knee. He had to bend to catch it. "Playing hard to get, wolfy?"

"Hard to get's the only game I know." The phone light vanished. Total darkness. "Voice only from here. Call out before you throw, and I'll find you."

Cody listened. He could hear Lukas moving somewhere to his left, weight shifting on concrete. He placed his fingers on the laces, stepped into it, and fired a heater into the darkness. Silence. Then a low whistle. "Almost parted my whiskers, otter."

"Otter?" Cody called back. "Why otter?"

"You showed up out of nowhere, slippery, hard to pin down." A pause. "And you've got that look. Like you're always watching the current, figuring out which way to swim."

Cody grinned despite himself. For a moment, he forgot about the note in his pocket. Forgot about Graves and the photos and the questions that wouldn't stop circling. There was just the ball, the darkness, and Lukas's voice somewhere ahead.

The next throw came without warning. One second nothing, the next the ball was inches from his face. He got his hands up on instinct, catching it but barely. "You didn't call it, asshole!"

"You want a whistle, bring one next time!" Lukas's voice echoed from somewhere across the tunnel.

Cody shook his head in the dark, still gripping the ball. Playing catch in a tunnel with a wolf. No lights, no cameras, no rules. The whole thing was ridiculous. He'd been running scared for days, and now here he was, throwing fastballs at a six-and-a-half-foot predator who called him "otter" like it was a compliment. A laugh escaped him before he could stop it. Not because anything was funny. Because nothing made sense anymore, and sometimes that was the only response left. He fired another heater into the dark, close enough to ruffle fur. The ball smacked into Lukas's palm somewhere in the black. A beat. Then: "Damn. Otter's got teeth."

"Had to. Only way to survive." The words came out before Cody could stop them. Heavier than he'd meant. The darkness held them for a moment, let them settle. Lukas's boots rang on metal, getting closer. Then Cody felt a paw brush his wrist. Lukas's thumb pressed against his pulse point, steady pressure, the way you'd check on someone who just said more than they meant to.

"Game's over." Lukas's voice was low. "Let's head back up."

---

The daylight hit like a flashbang after all that dark. Cody squinted, getting his bearings. Practice field stretching ahead, goalposts at the far end, bleachers empty. The sun had climbed high enough to wash the shadows out of the grass. Something moved in the gap under the bleachers. A shape, maybe, pulling back into the dark. Cody blinked against the glare, and when he looked again, the gap was empty. He told himself it had always been empty.

Lukas climbed up behind him and let the hatch fall shut with a thud. He dusted off his jersey, eyes already scanning the quad. "Sun's a spotlight. Anyone asks, we were checking sprinkler lines."

*Anyone asks.* Cody caught the phrase and turned it over in his head. A week ago, it would have meant nothing. Now it echoed with something Graves had said. *Secrets always have a cost.*

They walked toward the stone fountain near the fieldhouse. Water trickled from a wolf-head spout into the trough below. Lukas splashed some on his paws, washing off the dust. Cody did the same. The water was cold. It helped clear his head.

"You're quiet." Lukas glanced over, more curious than concerned.

"Just thinking." Cody kept his eyes on the fountain.

"About?"

*About a conversation I'm not telling you about. About a note in my pocket. About whether you're protecting me or managing me and whether there's even a difference.* "Nothing worth talking about."

Lukas watched him for a moment. His ears twitched once, then settled. He didn't push. But as they walked back toward the dorm, Cody couldn't shake the feeling that something had shifted. The tunnel had been good. Real. For a few minutes, he'd felt like himself again, like the person he used to be before everything went wrong. But now they were back in the light, and the doubt was still there. Waiting.

Lukas's paw brushed his shoulder as they walked. A small touch, barely there. The kind of gesture that used to feel like safety. Now Cody didn't know what it felt like.

His hand brushed his pocket. The note was still there. He didn't take it out, didn't look at it. But he knew where Office 412 was now.

And he knew the way back.

# Chapter 17: Highlighted Red

The October sun sat low and weak behind a sheet of clouds, throwing everything into that flat overcast light that made noon look like dusk. Cody's jacket, the charcoal canvas with the Timberwood crest, wasn't quite thick enough for the chill, but he didn't say anything. His legs still felt loose from the tunnel, muscles warm from throwing, and the cold air was almost welcome against his skin.

Lukas walked half a step ahead, scanning the path like he always did. Habit, probably. Or instinct. Hard to tell the difference with him.

They cut through a gap in the chain-link fence and onto the main path that wound toward the quad. Students passed in clusters, bundled in scarves and hoodies, breath fogging as they talked. A pair of rabbits in matching beanies. A squirrel darting between legs with an armful of acorns. Nobody looked twice at Cody. Four days ago, every set of eyes felt like a spotlight. Now he was just another shape moving across campus.

Lukas pulled out his phone, thumbs moving across the screen as he walked.

"Checking in with Gem," he said. "Seeing where she's at."

The phone buzzed a moment later. Lukas glanced at the screen and slipped it back in his pocket without showing Cody what it said.

*Checking in. Or checking up.*

Cody filed it away with everything else. The way Lukas always seemed to know where the pack was. The way he steered conversations, steered routes, steered everything without ever making it look like steering. Maybe that was just how packs worked. Maybe that was just Lukas being Lukas.

Or maybe Cody was being tracked, and Lukas was making sure Gem knew their location.

He shook the thought loose. Paranoid. He was being paranoid.

Near the row of evergreens that bordered the quad, a badger in a maintenance vest stood by a utility box, clipboard in hand. He looked up as they passed, eyes tracking them for a beat too long, then jotted something on his clipboard and went back to whatever he was pretending to work on.

Cody noticed. How the badger's pen moved too deliberately. How he didn't look at the utility box once.

*Probably nothing.*

But the thought felt automatic. Something he told himself because the alternative was too exhausting to consider. He was tired of seeing threats everywhere. Tired of that low hum of paranoia that had followed him since the portal. Maybe maintenance workers really did stand around with clipboards and watch students walk by. Maybe that was just how things worked here.

He didn't look back.

"Hungry?" Lukas asked.

"Getting there."

"Student Union's past the trees. Food's not bad. Better than the dorm vending machines, anyway."

They pushed through the gap in the evergreens, and the building rose ahead of them. Bigger than Cody expected. Wide brick facade, glass doors, students streaming in and out in a steady rhythm. A banner hung between two windows: GO BADGERS in forest green letters, the mascot snarling underneath.

Lukas pulled the door open.

The noise hit first. Conversations layered over each other, bouncing off the high ceilings. The clatter of trays against the long tables that ran down the center of the room, their attached benches scuffed and worn from years of use. Chairs scraping against tile. Somewhere, a burst of laughter that sounded more like a bark.

Then the warmth, wrapping around him like stepping into someone else's kitchen. The smell came with it. Not breakfast anymore. Grease from the grill, something with onions, the earthy sweetness of tomato soup. Steam rose from the food stations along the far wall, where students shuffled past with plastic trays.

The cafeteria took up most of the first floor, but it wasn't just tables and food lines. Near the windows, smaller round tables with mismatched chairs clustered together, students hunched over laptops or picking at salads. A row of vending machines hummed against one wall, a raccoon feeding coins into one while a fox waited behind him, arms crossed. Beyond the tables, a lounge area sprawled around a flatscreen TV mounted to the wall, some nature documentary playing with the sound off. A group of wolves had claimed the overstuffed couches, sprawled out like they owned the place. In the corner, an old arcade cabinet blinked and chirped to itself, ignored by everyone except a rabbit who kept glancing at it like he was working up the nerve to play.

Cody stood in the doorway, taking it in. The size of it. The noise. Wolves and foxes and bears and rabbits, all of them eating lunch, checking phones, arguing over nothing. Fur and feathers everywhere he looked. A moose with antlers that barely cleared the ceiling. A pair of otters sharing a plate of fish. A massive bear lumbering past with a tray stacked high enough to feed three people.

Four days ago, he'd been on the other side of a portal, eating gas station food in a dead-end town. Now he was standing in a college cafeteria full of talking animals, and somehow that was starting to feel normal.

"Grab a tray," Lukas said, already moving toward the food line. "Soup's usually safe. Skip the fish."

Cody grabbed a tray from the stack and followed. The line shuffled forward, students loading plates with varying degrees of enthusiasm. A wolf ahead of him was building a sandwich that could've used structural support, layers of meat and cheese stacked so high the bread looked like an afterthought. Cody waited his turn, watching the options pass. Turkey, roast beef, something that might have been ham. A vat of soup with a ladle sticking out.

"Turkey's decent," Lukas said over his shoulder. He was already at the sandwich station, hands moving with the efficiency of someone who'd done this a hundred times. "Roast beef's hit or miss. Soup's tomato today. You want coffee?"

"Sure."

Cody reached for the tongs.

By the time he got to the station, the sandwich was already made. Turkey, cheese, lettuce, no tomato. Sitting on a plate next to a bowl of soup that Lukas must have ladled while Cody was still three people back in line.

Cody looked at the plate. Looked at Lukas.

"You already made mine?"

"Faster this way." Lukas grabbed two coffees from the dispenser, steam curling up from the paper cups. "Line gets long after noon. Come on, I know a spot."

He was already moving toward the far corner of the cafeteria, weaving between tables with his tray balanced on one massive paw. Cody picked up his own tray, his lunch already assembled, already decided, and followed.

The turkey looked fine. The soup smelled fine. Everything was fine.

But something prickled at the back of his neck. That same feeling from the tunnel. From the jacket. From every moment since he'd landed in this world where someone else made the call and he just went along with it.

*He didn't even ask what I wanted.*

Not what kind of sandwich. Not if he liked tomatoes. Not if he wanted soup at all. Lukas had just... decided. The tunnel. The jacket. Everything.

Cody's grip tightened on the tray.

*He's helping. He's been helping since day one. This is what helping looks like.*

But another voice, quieter, colder, whispered: *Is it? Or is this what control looks like when it's wearing a friendly face?*

He pushed the thought down. But it didn't go quietly.

They ended up in a corner booth, partially hidden by a support column. Backs to the wall, clear view of the room. Lukas set his tray down and slid in, eyes doing a quick sweep of the cafeteria before settling on Cody. Even here, in a room full of students eating lunch, he was watching. Always watching.

*Protecting you,* Cody told himself. *He's protecting you.*

*Or keeping tabs.*

He sat across from Lukas and picked up his spoon. The soup was warm and filling, maybe a little too much basil. The sandwich was fine. Turkey, cheese, no surprises. Exactly what Lukas would have picked for himself.

Cody ate without tasting much.

Silence settled between them. The cafeteria noise filled the space, conversations rising and falling around them. A table of foxes near the windows burst into laughter at something on someone's phone. Two finches shared a bowl of seeds, pecking in synchronized rhythm.

"So," Lukas said, setting down his sandwich. "What were you studying? Back home."

The question landed somewhere between casual and pointed. Cody chewed, swallowed, bought himself a second.

He could tell the truth. English major, creative writing focus. But that felt like handing over a piece of himself he wasn't ready to give.

"Journalism," he said.

Lukas's ears tilted forward. "Yeah? You wanted to be a reporter?"

"Something like that. Asking questions. Figuring out what's really going on." Cody shrugged. "I like knowing how things work. Why people do what they do."

It wasn't entirely a lie. He'd taken a few journalism classes. Liked the structure of it, the way you had to find the truth underneath the surface. That part was real.

"Makes sense," Lukas said. "You've got that look. Like you're always watching, putting pieces together."

"That obvious?"

"Little bit." Lukas picked up his sandwich, took a bite, chewed thoughtfully. His tail flicked once under the table. "What year were you?"

"Sophomore. Would've been a junior next fall."

"Middle name?"

Cody paused, spoon halfway to his mouth. "Why?"

Lukas shrugged, tearing off another bite of sandwich like the question meant nothing. "Just curious."

"Dante. Cody Dante Guiles." He set the spoon down. "You building a dossier on me or something?"

Lukas's eyes flicked up, met his, held for a beat. Then he smiled, just a little, one corner of his muzzle lifting. "Just making conversation."

But there was more underneath. A purpose he couldn't quite name. Like Lukas was gathering pieces for what wasn't yet visible.

"What about you?" Cody asked, steering the conversation sideways. "Football's not forever. What's the plan after?"

Lukas set down what was left of his sandwich, wiped his muzzle with a napkin. For a second, something shifted in his expression. Softer, more open. Like Cody had asked a question that actually mattered.

"Physical therapy. Maybe coaching eventually." He leaned back against the booth, shoulders relaxing. "Help guys come back from injuries, keep them on the field."

"That's actually really good."

"Don't sound so surprised." But Lukas's tail wagged once, quick and involuntary, before he caught it. He looked away, cleared his throat. "Saw too many teammates blow out a knee and lose everything. Figured somebody should know how to put them back together."

Cody watched him. Lukas looking at his empty plate instead of meeting his eyes. His paw curling around his coffee cup like he needed something to hold onto.

*He actually cares about this. This isn't just small talk.*

"I'm not surprised," Cody said, quieter. "I just... didn't expect it."

"Expected what? Dumb jock, no plans past the season?"

"No. I just..." Cody searched for the words. "You seem like the type who lives in the moment."

"Maybe." Lukas pushed his empty plate aside. "But moments end. Gotta have something waiting when they do."

He said it casually, but there was weight underneath. Cody thought about the tunnel. Lukas checking his pulse after the too-heavy words. Always checking. Always watching for the thing that might break.

Lukas stood, stacking his tray. "Come on. We need to get you an ID."

The words landed heavy and sudden. Cody blinked. "Wait, what?"

"Campus ID. Gets you into buildings, lets you audit classes, makes you official." Lukas was already moving toward the tray return. "Gem's in Special Collections. She texted back, she's there all afternoon."

"Hold on." Cody stood, but Lukas was three steps ahead, sliding his tray onto the return belt. "Lukas. Wait."

Lukas turned, one ear swiveling back. "What?"

"You want to tell me what we're doing? Or am I just following?"

The words came out sharper than he'd intended. But he didn't take them back.

Something flickered in Lukas's expression. He glanced around the cafeteria. Students still eating, still talking, nobody paying attention to the wolf and the human standing by the tray return.

"Not here," Lukas said, voice lower. "Outside."

He headed for the door. And Cody, after a beat, followed.

Because that's what he did. He followed.

At least for now.

---

The quad stretched gray and quiet under the pale October sky. Brown grass, bare oaks, brick paths dark with old moisture. A few students crossed in the distance, heads down against the chill.

Lukas stopped near the fountain. Drained for the season, the stone basin empty, the wolf-head spout dry. He sat on the rim, the cold seeping through his jeans, and looked up at Cody. "Okay. I'm listening."

Cody stood there for a moment, hands shoved in his pockets. His knuckles ached. "Being in the system means being trackable," he said. "Right now I'm a ghost. Nobody knows I exist. If I want to disappear, I can."

"And what happens when someone decides you're inconvenient?"

Cody's hands curled into fists inside his pockets. "What do you mean?"

"A ghost is easy to erase." Lukas leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "No records. No paper trail. One day you're walking across the quad, next day you're gone, and nobody even knows to ask questions." His voice was steady, but his eyes were serious. "A registered student has a file. Has a schedule. Has people who notice when they don't show up to class."

"So I'm supposed to trust the system?" Cody's voice came out harder than he'd intended.

"You're supposed to trust that the system has rules. And rules leave trails."

Cody kicked at a dead leaf on the path. "And if the wrong person has access to those trails?"

"Then at least there's a record." Lukas held his gaze. "Look, I get it. Being visible feels like being vulnerable. But invisible is worse. Invisible means nobody notices when you're gone."

Cody didn't answer. Invisibility had been his armor for years. At school, in his neighborhood, at home when his father was drinking. You learned not to be seen. Not to be noticed. Not to give anyone a reason to look twice. And it had worked. He was still here. But "still here" meant something different now. Still here meant a world where people had claws and fangs and the dean of students had offered him a deal that felt more like a leash.

*Protection,* Lukas kept saying. *Paper trails. Accountability.* But Graves had said something similar, hadn't he? *I can help you.* Different words, same shape. And Cody couldn't shake the feeling that Lukas's logic sounded a little too convenient. A registered student was harder to disappear, sure. But a registered student was also easier to find. Easier to watch. Easier to control. *Who benefits from me being in the system?*

He thought about the note in his pocket. The office with the candy bowl and the family photos. The door that was still open. If he was in the system, Graves could track him. Watch his movements. Know exactly where he was at any given moment. But if he was a ghost, Graves could make him vanish without anyone ever knowing he'd existed. Two risks. Different shapes. Same teeth. And Lukas didn't know about any of it. Cody had kept that door closed, hadn't mentioned the meeting, hadn't told anyone about Office 412. He wanted to tell him. Knew he should. But the part of him that had been turning Graves's words over since this morning wasn't ready to close that door yet. He let it go.

Lukas let out a slow breath. "I'm not trying to control you." The words pulled Cody back. Lukas was looking at him differently now. Ears flat, shoulders hunched forward. "I know I... I do that. Make decisions without asking. Move before you've had time to think. Gem told me I need to stop. That you're not a project I'm managing, you're a person." He exhaled. "She's right. I'm working on it."

Cody sat down on the fountain rim. The stone was hard beneath him, but he didn't move.

"The ID thing," Lukas said. "It's not about control. It's about making sure you can't just vanish. Administration has rules. They have to follow procedures. If a registered student goes missing, there are forms, investigations, people asking questions. If a ghost disappears?" He shrugged. "Nobody even knows to look."

Cody turned it over in his head. The logic was sound. A name in the system meant accountability. Meant someone would notice if he stopped showing up. Meant the dean couldn't just make him disappear without leaving a trail. But it also meant visibility. A target on his back. A name in a database that the wrong person could find. He'd already weighed these risks. But hearing Lukas lay it out, hearing someone else say it, loosened something. Made the math clearer. Cody stared at the dry fountain, at the wolf-head spout frozen mid-howl. Then he nodded. "Okay."

Lukas looked up. "Okay?"

"The ID. We do it." Cody held his gaze. "But I need you to understand something. This is my choice. I'm not doing it because you told me to. I'm doing it because the math works out."

Lukas nodded slowly. "Fair."

"And next time you want to make a decision that affects my life, you ask first. Deal?"

Lukas's shoulders dropped. Relief, maybe. Or something close to it. "Deal."

They sat there for a moment, the empty fountain between them, the cold pressing in. Then Lukas stood and offered a paw. "Come on. Gem's waiting."

Cody took it and let himself be pulled to his feet. They started walking.

---

The library rose at the far end of the quad like something that had been there before the rest of campus existed. Gray stone and weathered brick, three stories of gothic arches and narrow windows. A clock tower climbed from one corner, its face yellowed with age. Gargoyles crouched at the roofline, worn smooth by decades of rain. Stone badgers flanked the main entrance, seated on their haunches with books in their laps. Scholars, Cody thought. Or guards. Hard to tell the difference.

Lukas pulled the heavy door open, and the smell hit first. Old paper, dust, the particular mustiness of books that had been sitting in the same place for longer than anyone could remember. The vestibule swallowed the cold air behind them, and suddenly everything was warm and quiet.

The main floor stretched ahead, vaulted ceiling rising overhead, thick wooden beams crossing like ribs. Tall windows filtered the weak afternoon light. Reading tables dotted the space, green-shaded lamps casting pools of warm light. A few students sat scattered among them, heads bent over books. A raccoon in thick glasses. A deer with antlers that nearly scraped the ceiling when he stood. The circulation desk sat at the center, massive and dark, manned by an owl who looked like she'd been fighting sleep since the library opened. A wall clock ticked above her head, each second landing with a soft click.

"Elevator's this way." Lukas nodded toward the back.

The stacks swallowed them, shelves towering overhead, spines cracked and faded. The smell got thicker the deeper they went. Paper and leather and something older underneath, like the building itself was breathing.

The elevator waited at the back, hidden behind a shelf of oversized atlases. Brass gate, accordion door, the kind of thing you'd see in an old black-and-white movie. Lukas pulled the gate open with a clang that echoed too loud in the quiet. They stepped in. The space was cramped, barely big enough for both of them, and Lukas's shoulders brushed the walls on either side. He pulled the gate shut and pressed a button that had been worn smooth by decades of fingers.

The mechanism groaned. Cables creaked somewhere above them. The floor lurched, and they began to descend.

The light changed as they dropped. Warmer, dimmer, the fluorescent brightness of the main floor giving way to amber warmth. By the time the elevator shuddered to a stop, the air had thickened, heavy with dust and the particular silence of rooms that didn't get many visitors.

Lukas pushed the gate open, and Special Collections spread out before them. Low ceiling, low enough that Lukas had to duck his ears as he stepped out. The walls were lined with glass-fronted cases, old books and strange artifacts visible behind the panes. Wooden card catalogs with tarnished brass handles. Converted gas lamps that flickered like they remembered flame. And in the back corner, behind a heavy wooden table surrounded by folios and tomes, sat Gem.

Her ears perked as they approached. Amber eyes flicked up from the document she was studying, the mechanical pencil behind her ear catching the lamplight. She looked at Lukas first, then at Cody, and something in her expression softened slightly. "Still breathing," she said. "Both of you. That's progress."

The words landed differently than they might have yesterday. Cody caught the way her eyes moved between them, assessing. She knew something had happened. Of course she did. She was the one who'd told Lukas to stop treating him like a project.

"Good to see you too." Lukas stopped at the edge of her table, paws shoved in his pockets. "Need a favor."

Gem leaned back, tail flicking. "You have that look. The one that usually means I'm about to regret answering my phone."

"Campus ID. Photo, name, barcode that scans."

"You're asking me to forge federal documents." Gem's ears flattened. "In the middle of a Tuesday afternoon. In a university basement."

"Can you do it or not?"

"I don't know, Lukas. I've never done it before." She pulled open a drawer and started rummaging. "But I've seen the templates. I know where the blank card stock is. And I'm reasonably confident I can make the barcode work." She pulled out a small camera, then a stack of blank cards, then a portable printer that looked like it had been liberated from the registrar's office. "No promises on the laminator. I borrowed it from the geology lab and I'm not entirely sure it still works."

Cody watched her gather the equipment. No practiced movements. No smooth routine. She was figuring this out as she went, pulling pieces together from different places, making it work because she was smart enough to improvise.

"Why?" Gem asked, setting the camera on the table. Her eyes found Cody's. Direct. Sharp. "Why does the human from another world need a campus ID badly enough for me to risk getting expelled?"

Cody opened his mouth. Closed it.

"Protection," Lukas said. "Paper trail. If he's in the system, he's harder to disappear."

"I wasn't asking you." Gem's pencil started tapping. "I was asking him."

The basement went quiet. Just the flicker of the gas lamps and the distant creak of the building settling. Cody thought about lying. About deflecting. About letting Lukas answer for him the way Lukas had been answering for him since he got here. But Gem had told Lukas to stop treating him like a project. She deserved honesty.

"It was his idea," Cody said, nodding toward Lukas. "But the logic makes sense. A ghost is easy to erase. A name in the system means someone notices if I disappear." He paused. "And I'm tired of other people making decisions for me. This one I'm choosing."

Gem's tapping stopped. Her ears swiveled forward, and for a long moment she just looked at him. Then the corner of her mouth twitched. "Good answer." She turned to Lukas. "See? He can think for himself. Like I told you."

Lukas's tail tucked slightly. He didn't argue.

"Stand over there." Gem pointed at the filing cabinets along the back wall. "Try to look like you've slept in the last week."

Cody walked over and positioned himself against the cabinets. Cold metal at his back, the smell of old paper all around him. He straightened his collar, tried to relax his shoulders.

Gem raised the camera. "Full name?"

Lukas opened his mouth.

"I can answer for myself," Cody said again. Quieter this time. Not angry. Just certain.

Gem's eyebrow rose. Lukas's jaw clicked shut.

"Cody Guiles." He paused. "But I'm guessing you don't want my real name on the card."

"Smart human." Gem lowered the camera. "Pick something. Something common. Something nobody's going to remember five minutes after they check your ID."

Cody thought about it. Not Otterton. Not some clever reference that would make Lukas feel like he'd contributed. Something boring. Something invisible. "Miller," he said. "Cody Miller."

"Major?"

"Journalism."

Gem typed it into her laptop, keys clicking in the quiet. "Year?"

"Sophomore."

She nodded, still typing. "Okay, Cody Miller. Journalism major. Sophomore. Look at the camera and try not to look like you're about to commit a felony."

He managed something that was probably closer to a grimace. Flash. He blinked against the afterimage, purple spots swimming in his vision.

Gem checked the screen. "You look like a student. Confused, slightly lost, definitely hasn't slept enough." She shrugged. "Perfect."

She fed the image into the laptop, connected the printer, and held her breath as the machine whirred to life. A card slid out, still warm. She ran it through the laminator twice, checked the barcode with her phone, and nodded once. "It'll scan. Probably. Don't use it anywhere with a live database check." She held up the card, studied it, then tossed it to Cody.

He caught it. His face stared back at him from the plastic. Cody Miller. Journalism. Sophomore. A person who had never existed until thirty seconds ago. He turned the card over in his hands. The plastic was still warm. The photo looked like him but didn't feel like him. Or maybe it felt more like him than the old one ever had.

*You're in the system now.* The thought should have felt like victory. Safety. A paper trail that meant someone would notice if he disappeared. But Graves's voice was still there, somewhere in the back of his head. *My door is open. If you want answers, real answers, not filtered through people who've already decided what's best for you...* The dean had offered protection too. Different words, different shape, but the same promise underneath. And now Cody had put himself in a system that Graves could access. Could track. Could use. Was this safety? Or had he just made himself easier to find?

"You okay?" Lukas's voice, soft.

Cody looked up. Both of them were watching him. Gem with her head tilted, pencil tapping. Lukas with that worried crease between his eyes. "Yeah." He slipped the card into his pocket. His fingers brushed paper, the note still there, still waiting. He pulled his hand out quickly. "Just thinking."

"Dangerous habit." Gem was already turning back to her laptop. "Don't make a career of it."

"Thanks, Gem." Lukas tilted his head toward the elevator. Not a push this time. An invitation.

They stepped into the elevator. The gate clanged shut. The mechanism groaned, and they began to rise.

Cody glanced back through the brass bars. Gem was already turning back to her desk, pulling a stack of documents toward her. But instinct made him keep watching. She stopped. Her eyes had found her monitor, and her expression shifted. Her tail, which had been flicking absently, went still. The elevator climbed. The basement fell away. And Cody lost sight of her face before he could read what was on it.

---

Gem stared at the screen.

The registration she'd just processed was highlighted red. A flag she hadn't put there.

DENIED — ADMIN HOLD — REF: OFFICE 412

Her pencil stopped tapping.

Office 412. That was Graves. Dean Victor Graves, who never flagged student registrations, who never touched the system directly, who operated through channels and committees and plausible deniability. Until now.

She pulled up the reference file. Empty. No notes, no reason for the hold, no explanation. Just the flag itself, blinking red like a warning. Or a claim.

Gem leaned back in her chair. Her tail curled around her legs, tight and still. She didn't call after them. Didn't send a message. Not yet.

First, she needed to understand what she was looking at.

She opened a new search window and started digging.

---

# Chapter 18: Office 412

The admin building. Fourth floor, corner office. Morning light cut through the floor-to-ceiling glass, throwing long shadows across the mahogany desk. The campus spread out below like a model someone had built to scale. The quad. The library. The science building at the far edge, its windows dark even now.

The chair faced the window. It usually did.

Victor Graves watched a pair of students cross the quad, backpacks bouncing, breath fogging in the cold. They walked close enough that their shoulders touched. Young. Careless. No idea what moved beneath the surface of their little world. His claws tapped the armrest once. Twice. A rhythm he'd developed decades ago, back when he still believed patience was a virtue instead of a necessity. The plain white mug sat at his elbow, coffee gone cold an hour ago. The "World's Okayest Dean" mug stayed in its drawer. No audience today.

Three knocks at the door.

"Enter."

The badger stepped inside. Security uniform pressed, clipboard in hand, eyes fixed somewhere around Graves's desk instead of his face. Good. The ones who made eye contact were the ones who thought they mattered.

"Sir. The human. We have eyes on him."

"I'm aware." Graves didn't turn. The window held more interest than the badger's nervous shuffling. "What's the status?"

"Spotted him leaving the library basement yesterday with Raines. Lost visual when they cut through the maintenance tunnels. Picked him up again near the athletic center this morning, then nothing." The badger consulted his clipboard like it held answers instead of questions. "Raines is keeping him moving. Using back routes, service corridors. Avoiding the main paths."

"He knows where the cameras are."

"Yes, sir. He's been here long enough to learn them."

"Raines." The name sat in the air between them. Graves let it sit. "The linebacker."

"Yes, sir. Lukas Raines. Junior. Starting lineup. His room's been flagged, but we can't move on student housing without cause. The RA would ask questions."

"Questions have answers. That's not a problem." Graves's claws stilled on the armrest. "The problem is timing. The human needs to be contained before Friday."

"The game, sir?"

"The game." Graves watched a crow land on the science building's roof, black against gray stone. "Fifteen thousand people in the stadium. Cameras everywhere. Donors. Parents. If our guest decides to walk onto that field in front of the crowd, it becomes a very different conversation. One I'd prefer to avoid."

The badger scribbled something. His pen scratched loud in the quiet office.

"Double the patrols near the athletic facilities. I want someone on Raines's schedule at all times. Practice, classes, meals. Where he goes, eyes follow." Graves paused. "Discreetly. The wolf is suspicious enough already. If he thinks we're closing in, he'll find somewhere we can't reach."

"Yes, sir."

"And send for Kashtar."

The pen stopped. "Sir?"

"Rumi Kashtar. Football team. The bull." Graves's voice stayed soft, the way it always did. "He should be finishing his morning workout about now. Have him here within the hour."

The badger hesitated. Graves could feel it without looking. The question forming, the doubt. Whether this was wise. Whether involving a student athlete in whatever this was crossed some line the badger still believed existed. The hesitation passed. It always did.

"Yes, sir."

The door clicked shut. Silence settled back over the office like dust on an old photograph.

Graves reached for his coffee, remembered it was cold, and set it back down. The mug left no ring on the desk. Nothing in this office left marks. He'd made sure of that years ago. Through the glass, the campus continued its morning routine. Classes starting. Students shuffling between buildings. The machine grinding forward, indifferent to the small dramas playing out in its gears.

Somewhere down there, a human was hiding. Breathing air that didn't belong to him. Walking on ground he had no right to touch.

Fourteen years Graves had waited. Fourteen years since TH-2010-003 expired in transit, taking with it any hope of meaningful data. Fourteen years of budget meetings and alumni dinners and watching younger researchers publish papers on subjects they barely understood. This one was different. This one was alive. Healthy. Ambulatory. Walking around like it belonged here. The preliminary observations alone suggested cellular adaptation unlike anything in the literature. If he could just get his hands on it.

His claws curled into the leather armrest. The material creaked, soft as a sigh.

Patience. The subject wasn't going anywhere. Raines thought he was protecting something precious, but all he'd done was delay the inevitable. The wolf was emotional, impulsive, too wrapped up in whatever attachment he'd formed to see the larger picture. That was useful. Emotions made people predictable.

A knock. Heavy this time. Different rhythm.

"Enter."

The door swung open and the frame filled with muscle. Rumi Kashtar stood in the doorway, arms crossed over a chest that strained against his workout shirt. Nose ring catching the light. Dark eyes that couldn't quite hide the hunger underneath the suspicion.

Graves let him wait. Five seconds. Ten. Long enough for the silence to become uncomfortable.

Then he turned his chair. The movement was unhurried. The leather barely whispered as he pivoted to face his guest for the first time. His expression softened into something that looked almost like warmth.

"Rumi." The name landed easy, familiar. "Thank you for coming. I know your schedule is demanding this time of year. Please, sit. Make yourself comfortable."

"Security guy said you wanted to see me." Rumi's voice was a rumble, the kind that came from a chest built for intimidation. "Didn't say why."

"No, he wouldn't have. I wanted to speak with you personally." Graves gestured to the chair across from him with an open paw. "Can I get you anything? Water? Coffee? I have some of those protein bars the athletic department swears by, if you're hungry."

Rumi didn't move.

Graves let the offer hang for a moment, then nodded like he understood completely. "Straight to business. I respect that." He leaned forward, elbows on the desk, paws folded. The posture of a man sharing a confidence. "I've been watching you, Rumi. On the field. In practice. You have something special. Raw talent that doesn't come along very often."

Something shifted in Rumi's stance. Not much. Just a loosening of the shoulders.

"Coach Henderson mentions you in his reports. Says you work harder than anyone on the team. First one in, last one out." Graves shook his head slowly, a hint of sadness in his voice. "It's a shame, really. All that dedication, and somehow you keep getting passed over. Raines gets the spotlight. Raines gets the scouts' attention. And you're left wondering what you have to do to get noticed."

Rumi went still. His arms stayed crossed, but his weight shifted forward. Listening now.

"I know that feeling." Graves's voice dropped, intimate. "I was young once, believe it or not. Talented. Ambitious. Watching lesser people get opportunities I'd earned." He spread his paws. "It's not fair. But the world rarely is. The question is what you do about it."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I'd like to help you, Rumi. I see potential that's being wasted, and that bothers me." Graves reached for the candy bowl on his desk, took one of the wrapped chocolates, and held it out. An offering. "There's a situation on campus. Something delicate. And I think you might be uniquely positioned to assist."

Rumi didn't take the candy. "What kind of situation?"

"There's a young man. A human. You may have noticed him around Lukas." Graves set the chocolate down, unbothered by the rejection. "He's in trouble, Rumi. The kind of trouble that could hurt a lot of people if it's not handled carefully. Including Lukas."

That got a reaction. A flicker of something in Rumi's eyes. Not concern, exactly. But interest.

"Lukas thinks he's protecting this young man by hiding him. But he's not. He's putting himself at risk. His scholarship. His future. Everything he's worked for." Graves shook his head again, the picture of paternal worry. "I've tried to reach out, but Lukas and I... well. He doesn't trust easily. You know that better than anyone."

Rumi's expression shifted. Recognition, maybe. Or just the memory of a friendship that used to mean something.

"I need someone Lukas trusts. Someone who can keep an eye on the situation. Make sure things don't spiral out of control." Graves met Rumi's eyes, steady and warm. "And in return, I'd like to make sure your hard work finally gets the recognition it deserves. Full scholarship. Starting position. A real shot at the future you've earned."

The bull was quiet for a long moment. His chest rose and fell, slow and heavy.

"You want me to spy on Lukas."

"I want you to help me protect him from himself." Graves's voice stayed gentle. Understanding. "Lukas is emotional. He makes decisions with his heart instead of his head. That's admirable in some ways, but it's also dangerous. He's going to get hurt if someone doesn't intervene. I'm just asking you to be that someone."

Rumi's arms uncrossed. His hands hung at his sides, fingers flexing like he was working through a problem he couldn't quite solve.

"And if I say no?"

"Then you walk out that door and we never had this conversation. No hard feelings. No consequences." Graves spread his paws, palms up. Nothing to hide. "I'm not here to threaten you, Rumi. I'm here to offer you an opportunity. What you do with it is entirely up to you."

The silence stretched.

Then Rumi's shoulders dropped, just slightly. The resistance going out of him, replaced by something that looked almost like relief. Like he'd been waiting for permission to do what he'd wanted to do all along.

"What do you need from me?"

Graves smiled. It looked warm. It looked kind. It looked like exactly the right response to a young man making a difficult choice.

"Just stay close to Lukas. Let me know where he goes, who he talks to. If the human surfaces, I need to know immediately. That's all." He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a card. Plain white. A phone number printed in simple black text. "My direct line. Use it anytime, day or night. You're not alone in this, Rumi. I want you to know that."

Rumi took the card. Turned it over once. Slipped it into his pocket. "Yeah. Okay."

"Thank you." Graves stood, extended his paw across the desk. A handshake between equals. "I knew I could count on you. Coach Henderson was right about you. You're exactly the kind of young man this program needs."

Rumi shook his paw. His grip was strong, but there was something uncertain in his eyes. Something that hadn't quite settled.

"I'll be in touch." Graves released the handshake and settled back into his chair. "And Rumi? This conversation stays between us. For Lukas's sake."

The bull nodded once. Then he turned and walked out, footsteps heavy on the carpet.

The door clicked shut.

Graves sat still for a moment, listening to the heavy footsteps fade down the hall. Then he exhaled, slow and measured, and the warmth bled out of his expression like frost sliding off a window. His pale blue eyes went flat as old ice. His claws curled into the leather armrest, leaving marks he'd have someone buff out later.

Rumi Kashtar. Resentment wrapped in muscle. The boy had been nursing that wound for years, letting it rot. All Graves had done was give it a target.

Useful. Predictable. Disposable when the time came.

He watched the campus through the glass. The crow was gone from the science building roof. A maintenance cart trundled across the quad, slow and purposeless. His computer chimed. The sound was soft. Almost polite. A notification he'd set up years ago, back when he still believed in being thorough. He turned to the monitor. Pressed a key.

**SECURITY ALERT: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ATTEMPT**
**Archive Section: Portal Research / Restricted (Pre-2015)**
**User Terminal: Library Basement, Station 7**
**Access: DENIED**
**User ID: G. Kindler (Student)**

Graves's claws stilled on the keyboard.

Kindler. The fox. The one who ran the unofficial lab in the library basement. The clever one who'd been poking around since the human arrived. He pulled up her file. Academic record. Spotless. Research interests. Dimensional theory, portal mechanics, cellular adaptation. Faculty references. Glowing. Clever girl. Too clever for her own good.

She was looking for something. His old research, probably. The early work he'd done before administration swallowed his career. Trying to understand what the human was, where he came from, what it meant. And now she'd tripped a wire she didn't know existed.

Graves leaned back in his chair. Miss Kindler had just made herself useful.

He opened his email. Began to type.

*Miss Kindler,*

*I couldn't help but notice your recent inquiry into restricted research archives. Fascinating curiosity.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

*I'm confident we can resolve this simply. Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*Warm regards,*
*Dean Victor Graves*

Send.

The email disappeared into the system. A small thing. A stone dropped into still water. But ripples had a way of spreading.

Graves turned back to the window. The quad was quiet now. Students drifting between classes, unaware. The library sat in the distance, its old stone walls holding secrets they couldn't begin to imagine.

Somewhere inside, a clever fox was about to learn what happened when you dug too deep.

He settled back in his chair and folded his paws. Friday. It would all be over by Friday. The trap was set. Now all he had to do was wait for the prey to walk into it.

# Chapter 19: The Flag

They walked.

The path curved around the edge of the quad, past the drained fountain and the old oaks with their bare branches scratching at the gray sky. A few students passed them going the other way, a raccoon with headphones and a pair of rabbits arguing about something that made one of them laugh. The lampposts were starting to flicker on, that in-between hour when the campus couldn't decide if it was still afternoon or already evening. Leaves skittered across the brick path ahead of them, rust and copper against the dark stone. The air had that crisp bite to it, the smell of cold dirt and dying grass.

Cody noticed it somewhere past Whitmore Hall. Lukas wasn't leading, wasn't steering him around cameras or pointing out shortcuts or explaining which buildings had side entrances. He was just walking beside him, their shoulders close enough that Cody could feel the warmth radiating off his fur. For once, that was enough, and it felt new.

The silence between them didn't itch the way silence usually did. Cody didn't feel the need to fill it with something, to perform, to be interesting enough to justify taking up space. He just walked, and Lukas walked with him, and the evening wrapped around them, comfortable and unhurried.

"Koi still spelling things at midnight?" Cody asked.

Lukas's ear flicked toward him. "Only if you're drunk enough to read it."

"Seems like a design flaw. Mystical fish that only talk to alcoholics."

"Campus has priorities." The corner of Lukas's muzzle twitched into something that was almost a smile. "You get used to it."

They passed a cluster of students on a bench, a fox and two deer huddled over a shared textbook. One of them glanced up as they walked by, then went back to the book without a second look. Another evening on campus, a wolf and a human walking together like it was the most normal thing in the world. Cody filed that away. A week ago, he would have felt like a target, an anomaly, something that didn't belong. Now he just felt like a guy walking with his friend. Friend. The word fit strange in his head. Like a jacket he'd forgotten he owned.

"You always like this?" The question came out before he'd decided to ask it.

Lukas glanced at him. "Like what?"

"I don't know." Cody shrugged, hands in his pockets. "Taking in strays. Showing them around."

Lukas was quiet for a few steps. The path curved past a row of evergreens, their branches dark against the fading sky. When he spoke, his voice was lower. Less guarded. "Someone did it for me once. Long time ago."

He didn't elaborate. Cody didn't push. Some doors you let people open on their own time.

They walked in silence for a while after that. The sky was turning purple now, first stars starting to show through gaps in the clouds. Somewhere behind them, a door opened and closed, laughter spilling out and fading.

Lukas slowed. Stopped near a bench under one of the old oaks. He sat down, leaning back against the worn wood, and looked up at the darkening sky. There was something different in his face. Softer. Like he'd set something heavy down and wasn't in a hurry to pick it back up.

"So what's it like?" he asked.

Cody lowered himself onto the bench beside him. "What's what like?"

"Your world." Lukas turned his head, those amber eyes catching what was left of the light. "What's it like?"

The question landed heavier than it should have. Four days Cody had been here. Four days of longer routes and careful paths and Lukas quietly putting himself between Cody and anything that might be a problem. A constant, steady presence steering him through a world he didn't understand yet. And this was the first time anyone had really asked about him. Where he came from. What his life had been like before all this.

Lukas waited patiently, ears forward.

Cody let out a breath. "When I was a kid... it was good. Really good." The memories came easier than he expected. "Summer barbecues in the backyard. The smell of charcoal and cut grass. My mom had this laugh that could fill up a room without even trying." He smiled a little. "My dad used to hoist me onto his shoulders at the county fair. Made the world twice as tall. All those lights and sounds, and I'm up there like I'm king of everything."

Lukas hummed, a low rumble in his chest that said *keep going.*

"We had this thing on Sundays," Cody said. "Pancakes. My mom always burned the first one on purpose. Called it the sacrifice pancake. Said the griddle gods demanded tribute before they'd cooperate."

"She had this garden. Tomatoes and basil, mostly. The whole backyard smelled like it in summer. She had a system. Little stakes with labels, watering schedule on the fridge, the whole thing. My dad used to tease her about it. Called her the plant warden." The smile widened a little. "There was this spot by the lake we'd go every year. Rent the same cabin. Mom would sit on the dock and read. Dad and I would take the rowboat out, try our luck with these old fishing rods that probably belonged to the cabin before we got there. Never caught much. Didn't matter. We'd just sit there, him and me, not saying anything. Watching the water. He'd point out the birds sometimes, tell me which ones were which. I don't remember most of the names now. But I remember the way it felt. Being out there with him."

The smile stayed for a moment longer.

"She got sick when I was eleven." The words came out quiet, and whatever warmth had been in his face drained away, slow and unstoppable.

Lukas leaned back against the bench, his shoulder pressing closer to Cody's. A quiet weight that said *I'm here.*

"Some rare thing they didn't catch until it was too late. One of those cancers that hides until it's everywhere." Cody kept his eyes on the darkening sky. "Took almost a year. I watched her shrink. That's the only word for it. Like she was disappearing a little more every day. Her voice got quieter. Then her laugh. Then her eyes. By the end she was already somewhere else. Even before she stopped breathing."

The words came out flat. Not because he didn't feel them, but because he'd felt them so many times they'd gone numb at the edges, like a scar you forget is there until someone asks about it.

"My dad too," he said. "Not his body. His everything else. He'd sit in that hospital room every day, and I could see pieces of him leaving with her. The part that laughed at her jokes. The part that pointed out the birds. The part that carried me on his shoulders. By the end, I'd lost both of them. She was just the only one who got a funeral."

Lukas didn't say sorry or try to fix it. He sat there beside him, solid and present, and that was enough.

Cody was quiet for a long moment. The campus had gone still around them, just the distant hum of traffic and the rustle of leaves in the wind.

"There's this little cemetery outside town," he said finally, his voice rougher now. "Chain link fence with a gate that never locks right. Grass that gets too long between mowings. An old oak in the back corner with a split trunk from a lightning strike years ago, still growing anyway. Her name's on a marker under that tree. I used to go every Sunday. Sit there. Talk to her about nothing." He swallowed. "Tell her about the book I was reading. Complain about my chemistry teacher. Sometimes I'd bring her flowers from the grocery store, the cheap ones in the plastic wrap. It was all I could afford back then."

He tipped his head back and looked at the sky, all wrong stars and strange patterns, and the weight of it hit him fresh. He'd never stand at her grave again.

"I'm never going to see it again."

His throat tightened. He blinked hard, jaw clenching against the pressure building behind his eyes. Something flickered in his chest, a heat that didn't belong to the grief. He breathed through it until it settled.

They sat in silence. Somewhere across campus a door slammed, someone laughed, life going on the way it does. Cody didn't have to explain what any of it meant. Lukas already got it.

"What would you tell her?"

Cody looked over. Lukas was watching him with that same quiet attention, the kind that didn't demand anything, just waited.

"If you could go back one more time," Lukas said. "What would you say?"

The question hit harder than he expected. Cody sat with it. The seconds stretched out. He turned it over, looking for an answer that didn't feel like too much or not enough. What would he tell her? That he survived? That he found people who actually gave a damn? That for the first time since she died, he didn't feel like he was just waiting for the next bad thing to happen?

He looked at Lukas. The fading light caught the gold in his eyes. Cody opened his mouth.

Lukas's phone buzzed.

The sound shattered the moment like a rock through a window. Lukas blinked, pulled the phone from his pocket, and whatever had been open in his face closed off the second he read the screen.

"It's Gem. We need to go. Now!"

He was already on his feet and moving. Cody pushed himself off the bench and followed, the question still stuck in his throat, the answer he'd almost given already fading into something he might never get a chance to say.

---

They found Gem in the library basement, hunched over her terminal with the kind of focus that said something had gone very wrong. The screens cast blue light across her face, and she didn't look up when they came in.

"Took you long enough." Her voice was flat. Controlled. But Cody could hear the current running underneath it.

"What happened?" Lukas moved to stand behind her, eyes scanning the screens.

"I was digging. After the ID got flagged, I wanted to know why. What we're actually dealing with."

"And?"

"And I found out." She pulled up a window. Text and file names, most of them redacted or incomplete. "Portal arrivals. There have been others, Lukas. Not many. But enough to have a system. Catalogue numbers. Dates. Status reports."

Cody stepped closer, reading over her shoulder. TH-1996-017. TH-2003-005. TH-2010-003. Letters and numbers that used to be people.

"What happened to them?" His voice sounded strange to his own ears.

"That's what I was trying to find out. I went deeper. Tried to access the full records. And I hit this." Gem clicked. The screen flashed red.

**ACCESS DENIED**
**ARCHIVE SECTION: PORTAL RESEARCH / RESTRICTED (PRE-2015)**
**UNAUTHORIZED USER**

"That was two hours ago," Gem said. "Then this showed up."

She opened her email. One new message, sitting at the top of the inbox like a bomb with a blinking timer. She clicked it open. Cody read the words on the screen, and something cold slid down his spine.

*Miss Kindler,*

*I couldn't help but notice your recent inquiry into restricted research archives. Fascinating curiosity.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

*I'm confident we can resolve this simply. Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*Warm regards,*
*Dean Victor Graves*

The timestamp on the email read 4:47 PM. It was past seven now.

"The deadline passed," Cody said. "What does that mean?"

"It means he's not waiting anymore." Gem finally looked at him. Her eyes were steady, but he could see the fear underneath. The anger. "It means whatever he was going to do if you didn't show up, he's already doing it."

Lukas's paw clamped around Cody's arm and yanked him toward the door.

"Lukas, wait!" Cody's heart was hammering, the email's words still burning in his vision.

But Lukas was already pulling him toward the door, grip tight enough to bruise. "Maintenance tunnels. No cameras. You stay hidden until we figure out a plan."

"Shouldn't we talk about this?!"

Lukas didn't answer. He was already moving, hauling Cody with him. Behind them, Gem's fingers flew across the keyboard, her face lit blue by the screen.

---

The tunnels swallowed them. Pipes ran along the ceiling, some wrapped in insulation that was peeling off in strips, others sweating condensation that dripped onto the concrete below. Caged bulbs threw pools of yellow light every twenty feet or so, leaving long stretches of shadow between. Lukas moved fast, boots echoing off the walls, taking turns without hesitation.

Cody followed, his mind still stuck on the words from that email. Academic standing. Scholarship review. Complications. Because of him. All of it because of him.

They stopped at a heavy metal door, rust creeping up from the hinges. A faded sign read VALVE ROOM 7 - NO ENTRY. Lukas pushed it open, revealing a cramped space lit by a single bulb that buzzed and flickered. Old pipes ran along the walls, valves frozen with age, gauges cracked and dark. A cot sat in the corner, the kind you'd find in an army surplus store, its canvas sagging in the middle.

"Stay here." Lukas's voice was tight. "Don't open the door for anyone. Three short knocks, two long. That's me. Anyone else, you don't answer."

"Lukas, this is my problem." Cody's voice cracked on the last word.

"This is me keeping you safe. Let me do that. Please!" Lukas's eyes were wet, his jaw tight, the panic barely held together by the need to move.

Cody nodded.

Lukas turned and pulled the door shut behind him.

The footsteps soon faded and silence pressed in.

Cody stood in the dim room, surrounded by dead gauges and rusted pipes, the conversation that never got to end still rattling around in his head. The email played on loop. Gem's face when she showed them. The way Lukas had grabbed his arm like he was afraid Cody might disappear. Academic standing. Scholarship review. Gem could lose everything she'd worked for. Lukas could lose his future, the scholarship that was supposed to carry him to professional ball, to a life beyond this place. Because of Cody. Because he'd fallen through a hole in the sky and landed in their lives like a grenade with the pin already pulled.

He crossed to the cot and sat down, the canvas creaking under his weight. The peace from the walk felt like it belonged to someone else now, some version of him from an hour ago who didn't know what was coming.

*That I found people who give a damn.*

He'd almost said it. Almost told Lukas what he meant. What he was starting to feel. Now he was sitting in an abandoned valve room while everyone he cared about scrambled to protect him from a threat he'd brought to their door.

Something stirred behind his ribs, heavier than rage. Guilt wrapped in helplessness, coiling tight.

His mother's face flashed through his mind. Not the smiling one from the pancake mornings. The other one. The one at the end, when she was too tired to pretend anymore. When she'd looked at him and he'd seen the apology in her eyes, like dying was something she was doing wrong. He'd sat there every day after school, holding her hand, watching her fade, and there was nothing he could do. Not a damn thing. Just watch.

And now people he cared about were in danger. This time it wasn't some disease he couldn't fight. This time it was him. He was the problem.

The email's words burned in his skull. Have the human come to Office 412.

Alone.

The word sat there. Waiting.

---

# Chapter 20: Cody's Choice

The word sat there. Waiting.

*Alone.*

Cody stared at the rusted pipes running along the ceiling. The cot's canvas dug into his back. The email kept circling, the same words wearing a groove into his skull: *Academic standing. Scholarship review. Have the human come to Office 412.*

He already knew what he was going to do. He'd known since Lukas pulled the door shut and left him here with three short knocks and two long. Maybe he'd known before that, when he saw Gem's face in the blue light of her terminal, the fear she was trying to hide underneath the anger. The logic was simple, the kind of calculation his pattern brain did without being asked. Dean wanted the human. Gem and Lukas were in the crosshairs because they'd helped the human. Remove the human from the equation, and the crosshairs had nothing to aim at.

*If I go, he leaves them alone.*

He sat up, the canvas groaning. The deadline had been five o'clock. It was past seven now. Whatever Graves was going to do, he was already doing it, and every minute Cody sat here hiding was another minute the people who'd helped him were paying for it.

And maybe, if he played it right, Graves would make good on that offer from this morning. *A way home.* The words surfaced unbidden, and Cody let himself turn them over. Back to the apartment with the stained carpet and the empty fridge. Back to his father's hollow eyes and the bottles lined up like soldiers on the kitchen counter. Back to the bus stop and the community college and the C-minus life he'd been sleepwalking through before the portal swallowed him whole. It wasn't much of a life. He'd hated most of it. But it was his, and going back to it meant Gem kept her research and Lukas kept his future and nobody else had to bleed for the mistake of caring about Cody Guiles.

Four days. That's all it had been. Four days of someone making him coffee in the morning. Four days of walking next to someone who didn't flinch when their shoulders brushed. Four days of almost saying something on a bench under the stars before a phone buzzed and stole the moment. And now he was going to trade all of it for a drunk father and a dead mother's grave and the same empty routine he'd been drowning in before.

It should have felt like a sacrifice. It felt like coming home to a house that had already burned down.

Cody crossed to the door and put his hand on the cold metal. The rust was rough under his palm. He thought about Lukas coming back to find the room empty, the cot still warm, no answer to the knock. He thought about the look on Lukas's face when he figured out where Cody had gone.

He pushed the door open anyway.

---

The tunnels swallowed him the same way they had before, pipes running overhead like exposed veins, caged bulbs throwing pools of yellow light every twenty feet with long stretches of shadow between. Cody moved fast, his footsteps echoing off the concrete walls, the smell of rust and damp filling his nose. He didn't know these tunnels the way Lukas did, but he remembered enough from the walk down to find his way back to the surface.

A set of metal stairs brought him up through a service entrance behind the library, and then he was outside, the cold night air hitting his face like a slap. The campus was quiet at this hour, most of the students either in their dorms or gathered somewhere with better lighting and warmer company. A few lampposts threw circles of orange light across the brick paths, and the trees stood bare and dark against a sky that couldn't decide if it wanted to be cloudy or clear.

Whitmore Hall sat at the far end of the quad, the same brick and ivy he'd walked into this morning when everything still felt like it might be okay. He knew the route now: front doors, past the reception desk, old elevator to the fourth floor, carpeted hallway to the door at the end. He'd done it once already today, following a note that promised answers. Now he was doing it again, following a threat that promised consequences.

He kept his head down as he crossed the quad, hands in his pockets, trying to look like any other student heading somewhere boring. A pair of rabbits passed him going the other way, arguing about a group project, and neither of them gave him a second glance. A raccoon in a maintenance uniform was fiddling with something near one of the lampposts, and Cody felt the guy's eyes on him for a second before he looked away. Probably nothing. Probably just some guy on the night shift. But the back of his neck prickled anyway.

The front doors of Whitmore Hall were unlocked, the lobby quiet and empty except for the same bored-looking badger behind the reception desk. The badger glanced up when Cody walked in, and this time there was no flicker of confusion, no moment of processing. Just recognition, and something that might have been expectation.

"He's waiting for you," the badger said. "Fourth floor."

Cody didn't ask how he knew. He just nodded and walked past the desk, feeling the badger's eyes on his back the whole way. The elevator was an old one, the kind with a metal grate that had to be pulled closed by hand, and it groaned and shuddered as it climbed. Fourth floor. The hallway was carpeted, muffling his footsteps, the walls lined with framed photos of past deans and graduating classes going back decades, everyone smiling, everyone looking successful and happy and like they belonged here.

Office 412 was at the end of the hall, heavy wooden door, brass nameplate: *Victor Graves, Ph.D. — Dean of Academic Affairs.*

The door was already open. Just like this morning. *My door is always open.*

Cody stopped at the threshold. Through the gap, he could see the edge of the window, the campus lights glittering below, the Dean's silhouette already turned toward the door. Waiting. He'd known Cody was coming. Of course he had. The window faced the quad. He'd probably watched Cody cross the whole way, counting his footsteps, timing his arrival.

"Come in, Cody." The voice was soft, warm, carrying that same friendly-uncle tone from this morning. "I was hoping you'd change your mind."

Cody stepped inside.

---

The office looked exactly the same as it had this morning.

Floor-to-ceiling windows with the campus spread out below. Family photos on the shelves: the silver-furred lynx with kind eyes, the graduation robes, the vacation shot with mountains. Ribbon-cutting photos on the walls, the thank-you card from the Class of 2019, the crayon drawing taped to the bookshelf like it meant something. The mahogany desk with the worn spot where paws rested, the "World's Okayest Dean" mug, the bowl of wrapped butterscotch candies catching the light.

The whole performance, unchanged. The mask made of furniture and frames.

This morning, Cody's pattern brain had flagged all of it: the dusty frames that hadn't been moved in years, the photos positioned outward instead of toward the desk, the candy bowl that was always the same amount. He'd walked out of here with doubt planted in his chest, wondering if the people protecting him were really protecting him or just keeping him scared. Now he was back, and nothing had changed. The room was still a stage. The props were still in place. The only difference was that this time, Cody knew he was walking into a trap.

Dean Victor Graves sat behind the desk in his charcoal suit, pale blue eyes taking in everything without giving anything back. He gestured to the chair across from him, and the smile on his face was warm, almost relieved, like a father seeing his kid come home after curfew.

The two chairs faced the desk, positioned so visitors sat backlit against the windows. Cody had noticed it this morning, the way Graves controlled the light, and he noticed it again now as he lowered himself into the left chair. The question was whether Graves knew that Cody knew.

"I have to admit, I wondered how long you'd wait," Graves said. "After our conversation this morning, I thought you might need more time. But here you are." He spread his paws, that gesture of openness he'd used before. "I'm glad you didn't let pride get in the way."

"You threatened my friends."

Graves tilted his head, mild surprise crossing his face. "Threatened? Cody, I simply pointed out the potential consequences of certain actions. Miss Kindler accessed restricted archives without authorization. That's a serious academic violation. I was trying to help her understand the situation before it escalated."

"And Lukas's scholarship?"

"Mr. Raines has been making some questionable choices lately. Missing practices. Avoiding his academic advisor. Using university resources in ways that raise questions." Graves spread his paws again. "I'm not the one who decides these things, Cody. I simply wanted you to understand the position your friends have put themselves in. For your sake, not as a threat."

The reasonable tone. The framing of everything as concern, as help, as the logical position of someone who just wanted to make sure everyone was okay. This morning it had worked on him, at least partly. The doubt had taken root, and he'd spent the whole day looking at Lukas and Gem through a poisoned lens, wondering if they were protecting him or controlling him.

But that was before the email. Before the threat. Before Cody realized that all of Graves's reasonable concern had been building toward this moment.

"What do you want?" Cody asked.

"I want to help you." Graves leaned forward, his pale eyes holding Cody's gaze. "We talked about this this morning. You fell through a dimensional rift. You're alone in a world you don't understand, surrounded by people you've known for less than a week. And your friends, as well-meaning as they are, have been keeping you hidden, keeping you in the dark, making decisions for you instead of with you."

The script hadn't changed. The manipulation was the same. But this time Cody let him talk.

"I know you want to go home," Graves said, and the words landed harder than they should have. "I could see it in your face this morning when I mentioned the possibility. The way you went still. The way something flickered behind your eyes." He paused, letting that sit. "You've wanted it since the moment you arrived, haven't you? Even if you couldn't admit it to yourself."

That wasn't true. This morning, Cody hadn't known what he wanted. He'd walked out of this office more confused than when he'd walked in, doubt and hope tangled together in a knot he couldn't untie. But the way Graves said it, so certain, so knowing, made Cody wonder if he was misremembering. Maybe he had wanted to go home all along. Maybe he'd just been too scared to see it.

That was the trick, wasn't it? Telling you what you felt until you believed it.

He thought about the apartment. The stained carpet, the empty fridge, the bottles on the counter. His father's eyes that looked through him instead of at him. The bus stop in the morning cold, the classrooms where no one knew his name, the grave he visited every Sunday because it was the only conversation he had left. He'd hated that life. He'd been drowning in it. But it was his, and there was something in his chest that ached for it anyway. Or maybe Graves was just good at making him think there was.

"What if I could send you back?" Graves asked. "The portal that brought you here isn't fully understood. But with proper study, with the right resources, there might be a way to recreate the conditions. The university has archives going back over a century. Equipment. Expertise. If anyone can find a way to return you to your world, it's us."

Home. His mother's grave under the oak tree with the lightning-split trunk. The chain-link fence that never locked right. Cheap flowers in plastic wrap. Sunday mornings talking to a headstone because there was no one else left to talk to.

He could go back to that. He could leave this place, leave Lukas and Gem and the pack, leave behind four days of feeling like he might actually belong somewhere. He could trade all of it for a drunk father and an empty apartment and the same gray routine he'd been suffocating in before the sky opened up and swallowed him whole.

And Gem would keep her standing. And Lukas would keep his scholarship. And no one else would have to pay for helping Cody Guiles.

"What would I have to do?" The question came out steady. Flat. Like he'd already made up his mind.

Something flickered in Graves's eyes, there and gone. Satisfaction, maybe. The look of a fisherman feeling the first tug on the line.

"Nothing invasive," Graves said smoothly. "Some tests. Observation. Documentation of your biology, your adaptation process. We'd want to understand what made you different, what allowed you to survive when others didn't." His paws opened, palms up, the picture of reasonableness. "You'd be helping us save lives, Cody. Future arrivals who might not be as lucky as you."

And there it was. The tell.

When Graves said "observation," his claws flexed against the armrest, just once, a tiny curl of the tips into the leather. His voice stayed smooth, his face stayed warm, but his body knew what "observation" really meant. Cody's pattern brain flagged it the way it flagged a defensive lineman shifting his weight before the snap. The Dean was lying. Not about all of it, maybe, but about enough.

He'd walked into a trap. He'd known it was probably a trap, and he'd walked in anyway, and now the jaws were closing.

"Why me?" Cody asked, keeping his voice steady. "You said others came through before. What happened to them?"

Graves's smile didn't waver. "You're unique, Cody. A human who survived dimensional transit intact. Do you have any idea how rare that is? The others... didn't fare as well. But the scientific implications of your survival are extraordinary. And I want to make sure you're treated with the respect and care that your situation deserves. Not hidden in maintenance tunnels like a problem to be managed."

"And if I say no?"

The smile stayed in place, but something shifted behind the Dean's eyes. The warmth was still there, but it felt thinner now, like paint over rusted metal.

"Then I'd be very disappointed," Graves said. "And I'd worry about your friends, Cody. Miss Kindler's inquiry into restricted archives has already been flagged. Mr. Raines's scholarship is already under review. These processes move forward whether you cooperate or not. But if you work with me, if you let me help you, I can make sure those processes reach the right conclusions." He spread his paws again. "I'm not your enemy. I'm offering you a path forward. The only question is whether you're brave enough to take it."

Cody's hands had curled into fists on the armrests, and he made himself relax them. The rage was there, coiling tight behind his ribs, the same thing that had gotten him in trouble on the football field. He could feel it pushing at the edges of his control, wanting out.

He forced himself to breathe.

"I need to think about it," he said.

"Of course." Graves nodded, still smiling. "Take all the time you need." He glanced at the clock on the corner of his desk. "Although I should mention that the situation with your friends will continue to develop regardless of your decision. The wheels are already in motion. But I understand if you need a moment to process."

Cody stood up. The chair creaked beneath him, and he turned toward the door, every instinct screaming at him to get out of this room, to find Lukas, to run.

He heard the click of a lock engaging.

"I'm afraid I can't let you leave, Cody."

The voice was different. Still soft, still quiet, but the warmth had bled out of it like heat escaping through a cracked window. Cody turned back, and the man behind the desk wasn't the same man who'd welcomed him in. The smile was gone. The pale blue eyes had gone flat and cold, and his claws were visible now, curved tips pressing lightly into the leather armrest.

"You came willingly," Graves said. "That simplifies the paperwork."

"What—"

"You really thought you could read me?" The Dean's voice was clinical now, precise, every word measured and placed. "I've been doing this for forty years, Cody. I saw you cataloguing the room the moment you walked in. The photos, the positioning, the tells. You thought you were being clever. You thought your little pattern recognition trick gave you an advantage." He stood, and the movement was slow, deliberate, a predator who didn't need to hurry. "I let you see exactly what I wanted you to see. And you walked right into it."

Cody lunged for the door, but it didn't budge. The lock was electronic, something built into the frame, and the handle turned uselessly in his grip. He spun back around, and Graves was already reaching for something on his desk, a small radio that looked like it belonged in a security office.

"Two for escort," the Dean said into it. "Office 412. The subject is secured."

*Subject.* The word landed like a punch to the gut.

"You can't do this." Cody's voice came out steadier than he felt. "People know I'm here. Lukas knows—"

"Mr. Raines knows you were in a maintenance room. He'll return to find it empty. He'll search the tunnels, the dorm, the library. By the time he thinks to check my office, you'll be somewhere else entirely." Graves set the radio down and clasped his paws behind his back, watching Cody the way you'd watch a bug in a jar. "The science building has an isolation ward in the sub-basement. Room B-7. No windows. Excellent soundproofing. You'll be very comfortable there."

The rage hit him then, fast and hot, flooding up from his chest into his arms. His hands curled into fists and his vision narrowed, and for a second he was back on that football field, back in that moment when everything went red and the only thing that mattered was making someone pay. He took a step toward Graves, and his whole body was shaking with the need to do something, to fight, to make this stop.

Graves didn't flinch. He just watched, those flat blue eyes taking in every detail, and the corner of his mouth curved upward.

"There it is," he said quietly. "The stress response. I've seen it before, in the others. Something in the biology of cross-dimensional survivors, something that runs hotter than it should." He tilted his head, studying Cody the way you'd study a specimen under glass. "The last one showed the same pattern before she expired. Elevated heart rate, pupils dilated, hands shaking. We never got to document it properly. She didn't last long enough." His smile returned, thin and clinical. "You will."

The door behind Cody opened. He turned to find two security guards filling the frame, a bear and a wolf in dark uniforms, both of them built like they spent their off-hours throwing around weights. The bear was holding something that looked like a heavy-duty zip tie, the kind you'd use on luggage or industrial equipment.

"Restrain him," Graves said. "Carefully. I don't want any marks that would complicate the documentation."

Cody swung at the bear, and the punch connected with something solid before the wolf's arm hooked around his throat from behind and yanked him backward. He thrashed, kicked, tried to break free, but they were stronger than him and there were two of them and his arms were being wrenched behind his back before he could land another hit. The zip tie bit into his wrists, plastic edges digging in, and then something else was going around his ankles and he was on the ground, the carpet rough against his cheek, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

"Transport him to B-7," Graves said from somewhere above him. "I'll be along shortly to begin the intake process."

Cody felt himself being lifted, slung over the bear's shoulder like a sack of laundry, and then they were moving. Down the hallway. Into the elevator. The metal grate rattled closed, and the last thing he saw before the doors blocked his view was Dean Victor Graves standing in the doorway of Office 412, straightening his cuffs, his face as calm and empty as a frozen lake.

The elevator shuddered and began to descend.

Something pricked the side of his neck. The wolf's paw, holding a syringe. Cody tried to jerk away but there was nowhere to go, and the bear's grip tightened, pinning him in place while the plunger went down.

"Standard sedative," the wolf said to no one in particular. "He'll be out in thirty seconds."

The fluorescent lights in the elevator ceiling started to blur. Cody blinked, trying to hold on, trying to stay awake, but his thoughts were already going soft at the edges, dissolving like sugar in water. The last thing he felt was the bear's shoulder digging into his stomach, and the last thing he heard was the elevator grinding to a stop somewhere far below.

Then nothing.

# Chapter 21: Room B-7

The first thing Cody noticed was the cold.

It seeped through his clothes, through his skin, settling somewhere deep in his bones like it had always been there and he was just now waking up to it. His head felt stuffed with cotton, his thoughts moving slow and thick, and when he tried to open his eyes the fluorescent light above him hit like a camera flash set off two inches from his face.

He tried to move his arm. It didn't move.

The restraint around his wrist was padded, medical-grade, the kind you'd see in a hospital psych ward. His other wrist had one too, and when he tried to shift his legs he found the same thing at his ankles. He was lying on something flat and hard, slightly reclined, and the surface under him was cold metal covered by a thin layer of paper that crinkled when he moved. An examination table. The kind a doctor would use for a physical, except doctors didn't usually strap you down first.

His mouth tasted like pennies and his throat was dry. They'd given him something. In the elevator, maybe, or right after. He couldn't remember. Everything after the guards hauled him out of Office 412 was a blur of motion and voices and then nothing.

He blinked until his eyes adjusted, and the room came into focus around him. Maybe fifteen feet square, walls painted the same institutional beige you'd find in a DMV waiting room. No windows. One door, heavy and metal, with a small reinforced glass panel at eye level and an electronic keypad on the wall beside it. A camera mounted in the corner near the ceiling, red light blinking steady. Equipment lined the walls: a heart monitor on a rolling stand, a tray of instruments covered with a blue cloth, some kind of machine with dials and readouts that looked like it belonged in a Cold War bunker. The air smelled like disinfectant and something else underneath, chemical and sharp, making his nose itch.

Cody's pattern brain did its thing automatically, cataloguing details whether he wanted it to or not. The door opened inward. The keypad had a three-second delay after the beep before the lock engaged, he could hear it cycling when footsteps passed in the hallway outside. The camera covered most of the room but had a blind spot near the instrument tray. The ventilation grate in the ceiling was maybe eight inches wide, bolted in place, way too small for a person but big enough to carry sound. He could hear the hum of machinery somewhere above him, the building breathing.

None of it mattered. He was strapped to a table in a soundproofed basement and nobody knew where he was.

The word came back to him, landing with the same weight it had in Graves's office. *Subject.* That's what he was now. A subject. Something to be documented and studied and eventually filed away when they were done with him. Not Cody Guiles from nowhere Pennsylvania with a dead mother and a drunk father and a pattern brain that couldn't stop noticing things. A specimen on a table.

He'd walked right into it.

He made himself breathe. Slow. Steady. The way his old coach had taught him before games, back when football was still something he cared about. If he looked at the restraints too long he could feel the panic starting to build in his chest, that animal urge to thrash and pull and tear until something gave. So he stared at the ceiling tiles instead, at the water stains in one corner spreading outward like tree rings counting the years since anyone bothered to fix the leak.

Dean Graves had played him. Every step of it, from the first conversation in Office 412 to the email to the moment Cody pushed open that valve room door, all of it had been exactly what Graves wanted. The reasonable tone, the concern, the offer of help. The doubt he'd planted about Lukas and Gem, making Cody look at the people protecting him through a lens of suspicion. The threat to their futures, delivered with such calm professionalism that it didn't even sound like a threat.

And Cody had done exactly what Graves predicted. He'd let his wound drive him. *People get hurt when I'm around.* The same thought that had followed him since his mother's hospital bed, since his father started disappearing into bottles, since his best friend crossed the street to avoid him. He'd taken that wound and let Graves use it as a lever, prying him out of the valve room and straight into the trap.

The sacrifice wasn't noble. It was stupid. It was exactly what a manipulator would expect from someone who believed they were poison to everyone around them.

Gem was probably still flagged for the archive access. Lukas's scholarship was probably still under review. Cody had traded his freedom for nothing, and now he was strapped to a table in a basement while a snow leopard with forty years of practice at this game decided what to do with him.

His hands curled into fists against the restraints, and he felt that familiar pressure building behind his ribs again. The anger wanted out. It always wanted out when he felt trapped, cornered, powerless. But losing control now wouldn't help anyone.

He let it burn. But he didn't let it take over. Not yet.

Because his brain didn't stop working just because he was strapped to a table. And somewhere in the back of his skull, behind the panic and the anger, the pattern recognition was still running.

---

The door beeped and swung inward, and Dean Victor Graves walked into Room B-7 like he was entering his own living room.

He'd changed out of the charcoal suit. Now he wore a white lab coat over a simple button-down, sleeves rolled to the elbows, reading glasses perched on his nose. The costume of a researcher rather than an administrator. He was carrying a tablet in one paw and a coffee mug in the other, steam curling up from whatever was inside, and he moved to the instrument tray without looking at Cody first. Set the mug down. Tapped at the screen. Checked one of the machines along the wall.

When he finally turned to face the table, the mask was gone. The smile, the warmth, all of it stripped away, leaving nothing but calm, clinical interest, the way a mechanic might look at an engine he was about to take apart.

"You're awake," Graves said. "Good. The sedative dosage was estimated based on your body weight. I wasn't certain how your physiology would process it."

Cody's throat was still dry, but he made himself speak anyway. "Let me go."

Graves didn't even acknowledge the words. He pulled a rolling stool from under the instrument tray and sat down, positioning himself at Cody's eye level the way a vet might sit beside a dog on an examination table. "I'll explain what's happening so you can process it. Understanding tends to reduce stress responses in subjects, and I want clean data."

"I know what's happening. You're a psychopath who kidnaps people."

Something flickered across Graves's face, there and gone. Mild disappointment, maybe, the way a teacher might look at a student who gave the wrong answer. "I'm a scientist, Cody. I've spent forty years studying dimensional anomalies, portal events, and the biological implications of cross-dimensional transit. When I started this work, my colleagues called me a crackpot. A fringe theorist chasing shadows. I published papers that were rejected by every major journal in my field. I sat through faculty meetings where people made jokes about my research while pretending I couldn't hear them."

He paused, adjusting the tablet on his knee, scrolling through data Cody couldn't read from this angle.

"Fourteen years ago, a portal event occurred on this campus. A human subject came through, similar to you. TH-2010-003, that was the designation. Female, early twenties, severely disoriented upon arrival. She survived the initial transit, which was remarkable in itself. The biological stress of dimensional crossing usually kills within hours. But she lasted three days." Graves looked up from the tablet, those pale blue eyes holding Cody's gaze. "Three days of observation before her system failed. Not enough time to complete the documentation. Not enough data to prove anything."

Cody felt something cold slide down his spine that had nothing to do with the room temperature.

"You're going to last longer," Graves said. "You've already lasted longer. Four days and counting, with no signs of systemic breakdown. Your cellular structure has adapted to this dimension's baseline reality in ways I've never seen before. Do you understand what that means?"

"That I'm a person?" The words came out harder than Cody intended, sharp and raw. "Not a lab rat?"

Graves tilted his head, considering that. "You're both, actually. You're a person who happens to be the most significant scientific specimen to appear in my lifetime. Your biology could unlock answers to questions no one has even learned to ask yet. Portal mechanics. Dimensional stability. The nature of reality itself." He leaned forward slightly. "You're going to make history, Cody. My history. When I publish these findings, when the data is undeniable, every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name. Every colleague who laughed will have to cite my work in their own papers. I've waited forty years for vindication. And here you are."

The camera in the corner was still blinking. Recording everything. Graves didn't even glance at it. Why would he? This was his building, his basement, his kingdom. No one was coming to review the footage. No one even knew this room existed.

"What are you going to do to me?" Cody asked.

"Document you." Graves stood, tucking the tablet under his arm. "Blood work, tissue samples, neurological scans. We'll monitor your cellular adaptation over time, track any anomalies in your physiology. I have equipment here that most universities can't afford, legacy systems from research programs that were quietly defunded when the government decided portal science wasn't worth pursuing." He walked to one of the machines along the wall, running his paw along its surface with what looked almost like affection. "Tomorrow we'll begin the intake protocols. Tonight, you rest. The sedative will be out of your system by morning, and I want clean baselines for the initial readings."

He gathered his coffee mug and moved toward the door, then paused with his paw on the keypad.

"I know you think I'm a monster," he said, not turning around. "I don't expect you to understand what this work means. You're twenty years old. You've never dedicated your life to something, never sacrificed everything for a truth no one else could see. But someday, when the textbooks are written and the history is settled, people will know that Victor Graves was right. That his research changed the world." He punched in the code, and the door beeped. "Get some rest, Cody. We have a lot of work ahead of us."

The door swung shut behind him. The lock cycled with a heavy click.

Cody lay there in the fluorescent buzz, staring at the ceiling, running the variables without meaning to.

Graves hadn't rushed. Hadn't checked the time or mentioned any deadline. He'd talked like a man who had all the time in the world, savoring the moment like a meal he'd been waiting forty years to eat. A scientist with his specimen, settling in for the long haul.

The door opened again maybe twenty minutes later. The wolf guard who'd helped wrestle Cody to the ground in the office stuck his head in, did a visual check, grunted, and pulled the door shut. Cody heard him talking to someone in the hallway, the words muffled but audible through the gap before the door sealed.

"Radio's worthless down here. Gotta walk all the way to the goddamn stairwell just to check in."

A second voice, deeper, probably the bear. "At least we're not dealing with that busted fire door. Thing's been on the maintenance list since I started."

"Right next to that service access in storage. When's the last time anyone even opened that thing?"

The bear laughed, a low rumble. "Probably before we were born. Come on, I need coffee."

Footsteps receding down the hallway. Then silence.

Cody let the words settle into the back of his skull, filing them away automatically. Radio dead zone. Fire door on the maintenance list. Service access in storage that nobody ever used.

He didn't know where the storage room was. He didn't know where the service access led. He didn't know if Lukas and Gem even knew he was gone yet, or if they'd have any way to find him even if they did. The pack might already be scrambling, or they might think he just ran off. He had no way to communicate, no way to send a message, no way to do anything except lie here and wait.

But his pattern brain kept working anyway, because that's what it did. It took the pieces and arranged them, looking for the shape underneath.

Radio dead zone meant the guards couldn't call for backup from down here. They had to physically walk to the stairwell to check in. That was a window. Maybe thirty seconds, maybe a minute, depending on how far away the stairwell was.

Service access in storage. A back way. Something old and forgotten, probably connected to the same tunnel network that ran under the whole campus. The tunnels Lukas knew better than anyone.

If they came for him. If they found this place. If everything lined up just right.

He'd know what to do.

Cody tested the restraints one more time, feeling the padded edges dig into his wrists. No give. No slack. He wasn't going anywhere under his own power.

But he wasn't helpless either. He had information. He had a brain that wouldn't stop working. And he had one more thing, too, one thing he hadn't had back home in that apartment with the stained carpet and the empty fridge.

He had people who might actually come for him.

The fluorescent light buzzed overhead. The camera blinked its steady red. Somewhere above him, the building breathed through its vents, and Cody lay there in the cold, running the variables, waiting for a moment that might never come.

But if it did, he'd be ready.

# Chapter 22: The Extraction

Time had stopped meaning anything.

Cody lay on the examination table, staring at the same water-stained ceiling tiles he'd been looking at for what felt like forever. The fluorescent light buzzed overhead, the camera blinked its steady red, and the restraints held his wrists and ankles in the same padded grip they'd held him in since he woke up. Nothing had changed. Nothing was going to change. Graves had left hours ago, or maybe it had been minutes, and the guards had checked on him twice, or maybe three times, and somewhere along the way Cody had stopped counting.

His pattern brain kept running anyway, cycling through the same information like a song stuck on repeat. Radio dead zone. Service access in storage. Guards have to walk to the stairwell to call for backup. The pieces were there, arranged and ready, but they didn't matter if no one came to use them. And with every hour that passed, the possibility that anyone was coming at all felt thinner and thinner, like a balloon slowly losing air.

He thought about Lukas coming back to the valve room and finding it empty. The cot still warm. The door unlocked. He thought about the look on Lukas's face when he realized what Cody had done, and whether that look was angry or hurt or just exhausted. He thought about Gem and Benji and Thorne and the rest of the pack, and whether they even knew he was gone, and whether knowing would make them come running or just make them shake their heads and move on with their lives.

Maybe this was it. Maybe he'd finally found the place where his pattern of driving people away ended, because there was nowhere left to drive them. He was strapped to a table in a basement that didn't exist on any map, and the only person who knew exactly where he was had no intention of letting him leave.

The fluorescent light buzzed overhead while the camera blinked its steady red, and Cody closed his eyes and tried not to think about anything at all.

---

The footsteps woke him up.

He hadn't meant to fall asleep, but the exhaustion had crept in somewhere between the third and fourth hour, dragging him down into a shallow, dreamless dark. Now his eyes snapped open and his whole body went rigid, straining against the restraints as he tried to figure out what had changed.

Footsteps in the hallway. That wasn't new. The guards checked on him regularly, heavy boots on concrete, the same rhythm every time. But these footsteps were different. Too many of them, moving too fast, and the rhythm was all wrong, like someone had kicked over a drum set in the middle of a song.

Then the shouting started.

"Hey! You can't..."

The voice cut off with a heavy thud, the sound of something large hitting the floor, and Cody's heart slammed into his ribs hard enough to hurt. He pulled against the restraints, craning his neck toward the door, trying to see through the small reinforced window. Shadows moved in the hallway. Another impact, another grunt of pain, and then footsteps again, closer now, almost running.

The keypad beeped.

The door swung open.

Lukas stood in the frame, chest heaving, fur disheveled, eyes wild and searching until they landed on Cody. For a second neither of them moved. Relief and anger and fear all tangled together on Lukas's face, and then he was across the room in three long strides, paws gripping the sides of the examination table, pulling Cody into a hug that bent him awkwardly against the restraints.

"You stupid..." Lukas's voice cracked, and he couldn't finish the sentence. His arms tightened, his muzzle pressed against Cody's shoulder, and Cody could feel him shaking. Whether it was adrenaline or emotion or both, he couldn't tell.

"Lukas..."

"I know." Lukas pulled back, and his eyes were wet but his jaw was set, the anger winning out over the relief. "I know. We're gonna talk about this later. Right now we move."

A massive shape filled the doorway behind him. Thorne, shoulders barely fitting through the frame, paws taped and ready. He stepped over the unconscious guard in the hallway without looking down and moved straight to the examination table, claws working at the buckles on Cody's restraints with surprising precision for paws that size. He didn't say anything, didn't need to, just met Cody's eyes once with a brief nod, and then the first restraint came loose and blood rushed back into Cody's wrist with a pins-and-needles burn.

"How did you..." Cody started.

"Later." Lukas was watching the door, ears swiveling toward the hallway. "Can you walk?"

Cody flexed his ankles as Thorne freed them, testing the feeling. His legs were stiff and his muscles ached from hours of lying in the same position, but the sedative had worn off a long time ago. "Yeah. Yeah, I can walk."

"Good." Lukas grabbed his arm and hauled him upright. The room tilted for a second, Cody's vision going gray at the edges, but he blinked it away and steadied himself against the edge of the table. Lukas was already moving toward the door. "Let's go."

They moved into the hallway, Thorne leading. The guard on the floor was the wolf, out cold, a bruise already forming on the side of his muzzle. Thorne stepped over him like he was stepping over a crack in the sidewalk, and Lukas kept one paw on Cody's arm, steadying him as they walked.

They made it maybe twenty feet before Cody heard it.

Footsteps. Coming from the direction they were heading. More than one set, moving fast.

Thorne stopped. Lukas stopped. They exchanged a look that said everything without words: the way they'd come in was blocked.

"Wait!" Cody's voice came out rough, but steady. "There's another way."

Lukas turned to him. "What?"

"Storage room." Cody pointed down the hallway, toward the end where it curved out of sight. "End of the hall. There's a service access that connects to the tunnels. And the radios don't work down here. The guards have to walk all the way to the stairwell to call for backup." He met Lukas's eyes. "That's our window."

"How do you know that?"

There was something in Lukas's voice Cody had never heard before. Surprise, maybe, the kind that comes when the person you've been protecting suddenly has the answer you need.

Cody felt his spine straighten. He'd been strapped to that table for hours, helpless, useless, and the whole time his brain had been doing what it always did. Gathering pieces. Finding patterns. Waiting for a moment that might never come. But the moment was here now, and he had an answer to give.

"I listened."

For a second Lukas just stared at him. Then he nodded once, sharp and decisive. "Lead the way."

Cody moved.

His legs protested with every step, muscles cramping and joints popping after hours of immobility, but he pushed through it because there wasn't any other option. The hallway stretched ahead of him, fluorescent lights throwing harsh shadows, doors on either side labeled with numbers and letters that meant nothing to him. Behind him he could hear Lukas's breathing, quick and controlled, and Thorne's heavier footfalls, steady as a heartbeat.

The storage room was exactly where the guards had said it would be, a heavy metal door with a faded sign that read MAINTENANCE: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Cody tried the handle, but it was locked.

Thorne shouldered past him without breaking stride. One massive paw gripped the handle, the other braced against the frame, and with a single sharp motion the lock gave way with a crack like a branch snapping. The door swung inward, revealing a cramped room full of shelves and cleaning supplies and, in the far corner, a metal hatch set into the floor.

"There." Cody crossed to the hatch and dropped to his knees, fingers finding the handle. It was old and rusted, the kind of thing that hadn't been touched in years, and when he pulled it groaned in protest but swung open, revealing a ladder descending into darkness.

The smell hit him immediately: rust and damp and old concrete. The tunnels. The same network that ran under the whole campus, the ones Lukas had led him through on his first day here.

"Go," Lukas said. "I'm right behind you."

Cody went. The ladder rungs were cold under his palms, slick with condensation, and he climbed down into the dark as fast as he dared. His feet hit solid ground and he moved aside, making room as Lukas dropped down after him, then Thorne, the big bear somehow fitting through the hatch despite his shoulders.

Above them, voices echoed in the storage room. The guards had found the broken door.

"Move," Thorne said, the first word he'd spoken since they'd found Cody. His voice was low and calm, like they were walking to practice instead of running for their lives.

They moved.

The tunnels swallowed them whole, pipes running overhead, caged bulbs throwing pools of yellow light every thirty feet or so. Cody didn't know this section the way he knew the route between the valve room and the library, but the layout was familiar, the same industrial bones running under the whole campus. He picked a direction and ran, trusting his pattern brain to find the way out, and behind him Lukas and Thorne kept pace, their footsteps echoing off the concrete walls.

They ran for what felt like forever but was probably only a few minutes, the tunnel branching and splitting, Cody making choices based on instinct and the faint movement of air that suggested an exit somewhere ahead. His lungs burned and his legs screamed and his heart pounded so hard he could feel it in his teeth, but he didn't stop, couldn't stop, because stopping meant getting caught and getting caught meant going back to that table and he was never going back to that table again.

The tunnel ended at a set of metal stairs leading up.

Cody took them two at a time, shoulder slamming into the door at the top, and then he was outside, cold night air flooding his lungs, stars scattered across a sky that had never looked so beautiful. He stumbled forward, almost falling, catching himself on a chain-link fence as Lukas and Thorne burst out behind him.

They were in a parking lot. Small, tucked behind a row of trees, the kind of overflow lot that probably only got used during football games. And sitting in the middle of it, engine idling, headlights off, was Lukas's truck.

Gem was behind the wheel, her face pale in the dashboard glow. Benji was in the back seat, laptop closed on his knees, watching the tree line with an intensity Cody had never seen from him before.

Gem saw them coming and her whole body sagged with relief. She didn't say anything, just reached back and shoved the rear door open as they sprinted toward the truck.

They piled in fast. Thorne took the front passenger seat, somehow folding his bulk into the space. Lukas slid into the back with Cody and Benji, pulling the door shut behind him. The doors slammed and Gem had the truck moving before anyone could catch their breath, pulling out of the lot slow and quiet, no lights, gravel crunching under the tires.

Nobody spoke.

The campus slid past the windows, dark buildings and empty paths, and then they were on the road, trees closing in on either side, the headlights finally clicking on as they put distance between themselves and the science building.

Cody sat in the back seat, lungs still heaving, hands shaking. Lukas was pressed against his side, warm and solid, and Cody found himself staring out the window without really seeing anything. They'd come for him. They'd actually come for him. He'd walked into a trap like an idiot and they'd come anyway, busted through guards and broken down doors and followed him into the dark.

Benji shifted beside him, and when Cody glanced over, the hedgehog's face was uncharacteristically serious.

"Pack protects pack," Benji said quietly.

Something cracked in Cody's chest. He tried to respond, tried to find words that would fit the weight of what they'd just done for him, but his throat closed up and his eyes burned and all he could do was dip his head once. He turned toward the window so no one would see his face, watching the road disappear behind them, and let himself breathe for the first time in hours.

The truck's engine hummed as the trees flew past, and somewhere behind them Room B-7 sat empty.

# Chapter 23: The Cabin

The turnoff was easy to miss if you didn't know where to look. Dirt road, no sign, trees closing in on both sides. Gem took it slow, the truck bouncing over ruts, headlights cutting through the pre-dawn dark. Nobody had said much since they left campus. Thorne was a solid wall of silence in the front passenger seat, and in the back Benji had his laptop closed on his knees with his head tipped against the window. Lukas sat pressed against Cody's side, close enough that their shoulders touched every time the truck hit a bump, but he hadn't said a word since they'd piled in.

Then the trees opened up and there it was.

The cabin sat in a clearing, backed up against a ridge. Single story, wood siding that had weathered to gray, a porch with two chairs that looked like they hadn't been sat in for months. Lukas's dad and uncle had built the place when he was a kid, and even though the Raines family hadn't used it much in the last few years, Lukas still came out to do upkeep every spring. Twenty minutes from campus, far enough to feel like another world.

Gem killed the engine. Out here, silence meant crickets and wind through the pines, and somewhere nearby the faint sound of running water.

Thorne opened his door and the cold rushed in, which was enough to get them moving. Lukas grabbed a bag from the truck bed and headed for the porch, crouching down to pull a key from under the third plank on the left. The door swung open with a creak that echoed in the quiet.

Inside smelled like dust and old wood. Lukas hit the light switch and a single bulb flickered on, casting yellow light across the main room. Not much to see: a couch older than Lukas, worn soft in the middle, a small kitchen along the back wall, a door on the left that led to the bedroom, another to the bathroom. Thorne moved toward the couch and started pulling cushions off to check the frame, already thinking about where everyone would sleep. Benji collapsed into the nearest chair like his strings had been cut. Gem stood in the middle of the room, looking around, then headed for the kitchen and started opening cabinets.

"Not much here," she said, closing the last one. Dust and a few ancient cans. It was the first thing anyone had said in twenty minutes.

Cody stayed near the door, not sure where to put himself. The cabin was safe, he knew that. Off campus, out of Graves's reach, hidden in the county somewhere between Timberwood and nowhere. But his body hadn't caught up yet. His hands still wanted to shake, his chest still tight. Every time he closed his eyes he saw fluorescent lights and felt the cold of that metal table against his back.

"Hey."

Lukas was standing by the bedroom door, one paw braced against the frame. He jerked his head toward the back of the cabin. "Come here a minute."

Cody followed him into a small room with a window facing the trees. A bed with a quilt that looked handmade, a dresser with a lamp on it, nothing else. Lukas closed the door behind them and stood there for a second, not saying anything, just looking at Cody with those amber eyes that always seemed to see more than Cody wanted them to.

"You're an idiot," Lukas said finally.

The word landed like a slap, but Cody didn't flinch. He'd been calling himself worse for hours. "I know."

"You walked right into his office. Alone. After everything we told you."

Cody's chest ached. He could hear the hurt underneath the anger, could see it in the tight line of Lukas's shoulders. "I know."

"He could've killed you." Lukas's voice cracked on the last word, and he turned away, one paw running over his muzzle like he was trying to hold himself together. "He had you strapped to a table, Cody. Do you get that? We didn't know where you were. We didn't know if you were alive. Benji had to hack into a security system older than my truck just to find out which building they'd taken you to, and the whole time I kept thinkin'..." He stopped, shook his head. "Don't matter what I was thinkin'."

"It does matter."

Lukas went still. Cody could see the muscles in his jaw working, the way his paws curled at his sides.

"No, it don't, because you're here now and you're fine and that's what matters." Lukas faced him again, and his eyes were wet but his jaw was set, anger and relief fighting for control of his face. "But you don't get to do that again. You hear me? You don't get to make that call alone. Not anymore."

"He was going to hurt Gem," Cody said. "He was going to take your scholarship. Because of me. Because I'm here."

"So you just handed yourself over? That was your plan?"

"I thought if I went, he'd leave you alone. All of you. I thought..." Cody's throat tightened, and he had to look away. "I thought I was protecting you."

The room went quiet. Outside, a bird started up somewhere in the trees, the first sound of morning. Cody stared at the floor and waited for Lukas to tell him how stupid that was, how naive, how he should have known better.

Instead, Lukas said, "That ain't how this works."

Cody lifted his head.

"You don't get to trade yourself for us," Lukas said. His voice had gone softer, the anger bleeding out of it, leaving something rawer underneath. "That ain't protection. That's just you decidin' you matter less than we do, and that ain't true. You hear me?"

"Lukas..." Cody's voice broke on the name. He wanted to argue, wanted to explain that this was different, that he'd done the math and it made sense at the time. But standing here with Lukas looking at him like that, all he could feel was how wrong he'd been.

"It ain't true." Lukas crossed the room in two steps and grabbed Cody's shoulders, not hard, just firm enough to make him meet his eyes. "You're pack now. That means we protect each other. Not you throwin' yourself on the fire so the rest of us stay warm. That ain't how it works. That ain't ever gonna be how it works."

Part of him wanted to push back. To explain that this was what he did, what he'd always done, that people got hurt when he stuck around too long and leaving first was the only way to keep the damage contained. But the words wouldn't come. His eyes burned and his throat felt like someone had their fist around it, and all he could do was stand there and let Lukas hold him in place.

"Okay," he managed. "Okay."

Lukas's grip loosened, but he didn't let go. For a long moment they just stood there, close enough that Cody could feel the heat coming off Lukas's fur, could hear the steady rhythm of his breathing. Then Lukas leaned forward and pressed his forehead against Cody's, just for a second, a gesture that seemed older than words.

"Get some sleep," Lukas said quietly. "We'll figure out the rest later."

Early morning light was already creeping through the window. In the main room, Cody could hear Thorne settling onto the couch, the old frame groaning under his weight. Benji muttering something as he curled into the armchair. Gem's footsteps padding toward the kitchen table, then stopping.

Lukas pulled back, but not far. "Bed's yours. I'll take the floor."

"Lukas, you don't have to..."

"Ain't askin'." Lukas grabbed a spare blanket from the dresser and dropped it on the worn rug beside the bed. "Go on. Lay down before you fall down."

Cody didn't have the energy to argue. He sat on the edge of the mattress, then let himself tip back onto the handmade quilt. The ceiling was plain white, cracked in one corner. Beside him, he heard Lukas settle onto the floor, the blanket rustling as he got comfortable.

*You're pack now.*

It was such a simple thing to say. Four words. But lying here in the thin morning light, with Lukas's breathing slowing into something like sleep just a few feet away, Cody finally understood what it meant. Not just words. Not just sentiment. These people had broken into a building and fought through guards and followed him into the dark, and they'd done it because he was theirs and they were his and that was just how it worked.

Outside, the birds were getting louder as the sun climbed higher. Somewhere nearby, the creek made a sound like a whisper through the trees.

Cody closed his eyes, and this time the darkness was just darkness, and he let it take him.

# Chapter 24: What We Carry

Cody woke to the smell of food and the sound of paper crinkling. For a second he didn't know where he was. The ceiling was wrong, the light coming from the wrong direction, and his body ached in places he didn't remember having. Then it came back: the cabin, the extraction, Lukas on the floor beside the bed. The floor was empty now, blanket folded and set on the dresser. He sat up slowly, wincing at the stiffness in his shoulders, and followed the smell out into the main room.

The pack was gathered around the small kitchen table, which was covered in white deli paper and wrapped sandwiches. Thorne was already halfway through something that looked like it weighed about two pounds, and Benji had his laptop open while picking at a bag of chips. Gem sat with a sandwich unwrapped in front of her, making notes in a small notebook. Lukas leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching the door Cody had just come through.

"Sleeping beauty rises," Benji said without looking up.

Cody's stomach growled loud enough that Thorne's ears twitched. He hadn't eaten since lunch with Lukas yesterday, and that felt like it belonged to a different lifetime. "Where'd all this come from?"

"Deli about ten minutes down the road," Gem said. "Thorne made a run while you were out."

Cody looked at the spread: turkey, roast beef, something with peppers. His mouth watered. "You got hoagies?"

Benji's quills twitched. "Hoagies. That's such a coastal thing to say."

"It's what they're called."

"They're called subs. Or sandwiches. Like normal mammals."

"Normal mammals are wrong." Cody grabbed the roast beef and unwrapped it, not bothering to sit down. The first bite hit him harder than he expected, and he had to close his eyes for a second just to remember what real food tasted like.

Lukas moved to stand beside him, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Cody looked up to find those amber eyes watching him, checking. He gave a small nod. *I'm okay. Or I will be.* Lukas's tail did a single slow wag, barely visible, and he turned back to lean against the counter.

They ate. The cabin was quiet except for chewing and the occasional chip bag crinkle. Cody glanced at the kitchen cabinets, which were bare except for dust and a few ancient cans. The deli run made sense. There was nothing here to work with. After a few minutes, Gem set down her pen and turned to Benji. "Show them what you got."

Benji wiped his paws on his jeans and turned the laptop so everyone could see. "Okay, so. You all know I got into the science building's security system. Fifteen-year-old protocols, default passwords, the whole thing's held together with duct tape and wishful thinking." He clicked through a few windows. "But here's the part that matters." The screen showed grainy footage, a timestamp in the corner. A room Cody recognized instantly: beige walls, metal table, that red blinking light in the upper corner that he'd stared at for hours while strapped down and trying not to panic.

"B-7's camera was recording the whole time," Benji said, his voice losing some of its usual bounce. "Everything Graves said to you, Cody. I have all of it."

Cody watched himself on the screen, head turned toward that camera he'd memorized every detail of. Then Graves walked into frame, lab coat crisp, that patient smile already in place. The audio crackled but came through clear enough.


His sandwich turned to chalk in his mouth. He set it down. The room went still as the recording played. Cody couldn't look at the others, so he stared at the wood grain of the table while his own voice came through the speakers, thin and scared, asking questions that got calm non-answers. When Graves mentioned TH-2010-003, the female subject who lasted three days, Gem made a soft sound. When he talked about journals begging to print his name, Thorne's claws scraped against the table.

The footage ended. Benji closed the laptop carefully, like it might bite him. For a long moment nobody spoke.

"I cut the feed before Lukas and Thorne went in," Benji said finally. "Guards never saw the extraction. As far as Graves knows, you just vanished."

Gem was leaning forward now, that sharp focus Cody had seen before locked onto the closed laptop. Her tail had gone completely still. "Benji. That footage. It's timestamped?"

"Yeah. Date, time, location metadata. The whole thing."

"And it shows his face clearly? His voice is identifiable?"

"Crystal clear. Old camera, but decent quality."

Gem sat back, recognition crossing her face like a puzzle piece clicking into place. "That's not just evidence," she said slowly. "That's a confession. Recorded. Timestamped. On university equipment, in a university building, showing a dean admitting to kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment." She glanced around the table, and for the first time since Cody had met her, Gem Kindler was almost smiling. "That's how we take him down."

Another silence settled over the table, but this one felt different. Charged instead of heavy. Then Benji's laptop made a sharp beeping sound, and he flinched hard enough to knock his chips off the table. "Shit." He grabbed for the computer, paws fumbling. "Shit, shit, come on..."

"What?" Gem's voice went sharp.

"Nothing, it's fine, just..." Benji's paws were shaking as he typed. The screen flickered, went dark, came back with an error message. "No. No no no, not now." He kept typing, faster, more frantic. The error message multiplied, cascading across the screen.

"Benji." Gem again, harder this time. "What's happening?"

"I don't know! It was fine, it was working, everything was backed up and now it's just..." He slammed his paw against the table hard enough to make the sandwiches jump. "Come ON!" The outburst hung in the air. Benji stared at the screen, shoulders hunched, breathing hard. Then all the fight drained out of him at once and he slumped back, paws over his face. "Sorry," he said, muffled. "Sorry, I just... I can't be the reason this doesn't work."

"It's probably just a glitch," Gem said. "We can fix it."

"It's not about the glitch." Benji dropped his paws. His eyes were wet. "It's about... okay, this is going to sound stupid, but I've never had this before? Like, any of this?" He gestured vaguely at the room, at all of them, his quills flattening against his head in a way Cody hadn't seen before. "People who actually show up," he continued, the words coming faster now. "People who stick around when things get hard. My whole life it's been backup plans and exit strategies because everyone leaves eventually, right? That's just how it works. You learn not to count on anyone because counting on people is how you end up alone at three AM wondering what you did wrong this time." He let out a shaky breath. "But then there's this. You guys. And it's real, and it matters, and I keep waiting for the part where it falls apart. Where I mess something up and everyone disappears. And if I screw up this one thing, this one important thing, maybe that's when it happens. Maybe that's the reason everyone finally..."

He couldn't finish. Thorne reached over and put one massive paw on Benji's shoulder, steady and solid, not saying anything.

Cody's throat tightened. He didn't know Benji well, not really, but he knew that math. He'd done it himself more times than he could count.

"You're not going to screw it up," Gem said, her voice softer than Cody had heard it before. "And even if something goes wrong, we figure it out together. That's the whole point."

Benji nodded, wiping at his eyes with the back of his paw. "Yeah. I know. I know that, I just..." He let out a shaky laugh. "Wow, okay, that was way more feelings than I planned for a Thursday. Can we pretend I said something clever instead? I have a reputation to maintain."

"We know," Lukas said quietly from the counter. "We all know." The laptop screen flickered again, then stabilized. The error messages cleared.

"See?" Benji's voice was still rough, but steadier. "Just a glitch."

"Just a glitch," Gem agreed.

But the room felt different now. Cody could see it in the way Thorne's paw lingered on Benji's shoulder before pulling back. In the way Gem was looking at the hedgehog without her usual clinical edge. In the way Lukas had gone still, arms crossed, watching Benji with that same protective focus he usually saved for Cody. A wall had come down. Not a big one, maybe, but enough to let some light through.


They took a break after that. Cody stepped outside to clear his head, leaning against the porch railing and watching the trees sway in the afternoon breeze. The creek was louder out here, a constant murmur underneath the wind.

The door opened behind him. Gem came out, notebook still tucked under one arm, and leaned against the railing beside him.

"You holding up okay?" she asked.

Cody shrugged. "Weird question to answer. I'm not strapped to a table anymore, so that's an improvement."

"Low bar." The corner of her mouth twitched, not quite a smile but close.

"It's the one I've got." He glanced over at her. "What about you? You've been scribbling in that notebook since we got here."

Gem's ears twitched. "Habit. When things get complicated, I make lists. Helps me feel like I have some control over the chaos." She tapped the notebook against the railing. "Probably looks neurotic from the outside."

"Looks like someone who's trying to keep track of a lot of moving pieces."

"That's a generous read." She was quiet for a moment, watching the tree line. When she spoke again, her voice had shifted, gone softer. "I couldn't save someone once. That's why I am the way I am. The patterns, the data, the obsessive checking. It started because I missed something I should have caught."

Cody waited. Gave her the space to find her own way into it, the same way she'd given Benji space ten minutes ago.

"Freshman year." Gem's grip on the notebook had gone white-knuckled. "There was a girl in my cohort, a vole named Petra. Sharp mind, good instincts, working on cross-dimensional energy signatures. Her advisor was this professor, big name in the department, lots of publications." Her mouth twisted. "He stole her work. Published it under his name, claimed she was just a lab assistant who'd misremembered her contributions."

Cody's hands curled around the railing. He thought about Graves in that lab coat, that patient smile, all that calm certainty while he explained how Cody was going to make history. "Damn."

"I saw pieces of it happening," Gem said. "Little things. The way he'd dismiss her ideas in meetings and then bring them up later as his own. The way her name kept sliding off drafts. The way she started flinching when he walked into the lab." She shook her head. "I had all the data points, Cody. Every single one. But I didn't connect them fast enough. By the time I figured out what was happening, she'd already gone to administration."

"What did they do?"

"Buried it." Gem's tail flicked once, sharp. "Called it a misunderstanding. Suggested she might be struggling with the pressure of graduate work. The professor kept his position, kept his grants, kept his reputation. Petra transferred out a month later. I never heard from her again."

Cody thought about that. A girl with a sharp mind and good instincts, ground down by someone with more power and better connections. A system that protected the wrong people because protecting them was easier than asking hard questions. His chest ached, and he wasn't sure if it was for Petra or for himself.

"So now you build the patterns before they finish forming," he said quietly.

Gem nodded. "I track the data before it goes missing. I make sure that if someone's being hurt, I see it coming in time to actually do something about it." She finally met his gaze, and the exhaustion in her face was the same kind he saw in the mirror. "Petra was the first person I failed to protect. I made myself a promise after she left. Never again."

The name Graves sat heavy in Cody's throat. He remembered Gem in that basement, the day she'd tested him. The way she'd kept her voice lower than necessary, positioned them in a corner where the camera couldn't reach. He hadn't understood it then. He was starting to now.

"Thank you," he said finally. "For catching it this time."

Gem's smile was small but real. "Thank me after tomorrow. We've still got a Dean to destroy." She paused at the door, looking back. "And Cody? I'm glad you're here. Even if the circumstances are terrible."

She went back inside, and Cody stayed on the porch, watching the trees bend and straighten in the wind. He thought about his own weight, the thing he'd been carrying since before he fell through a portal into a world that shouldn't exist. Sooner or later they were going to ask. Sooner or later he was going to have to decide whether to answer.

The wind picked up again, cold against his face, and Cody stayed where he was, letting it push against him while he tried to figure out what he was willing to let go.


The planning session lasted most of the afternoon.

They gathered back around the kitchen table, sandwiches pushed aside to make room for Benji's laptop and Gem's notebook. The footage sat on the screen like a loaded weapon, paused on Graves's face mid-sentence.

"The problem," Gem said, "is that official channels won't help us. Graves has fifteen years of institutional protection. Connections to the board, donors, everyone who matters. We take this to administration, it gets buried. Police means months of investigation, and he has plenty of time to destroy evidence and control the narrative."

"So we skip the middlemen," Benji said, drumming his claws on the table. "Go straight to the people." His eyes lit up the way they did when he was three steps ahead of everyone else. "Game Day. Forty thousand mammals in one place, half the state watching on TV. We put that footage on the Jumbotron and let them all see exactly what kind of Dean they've been cheering for."

Gem leaned forward, running the numbers in her head. "That's... actually not insane. Media presence, witnesses everywhere, no way to spin it quietly. By the time he could even try damage control, the story's already out."

"Benji, can you actually do it?" Lukas asked. "The PA system, the screens, all of it?"

"Stadium IT is somehow worse than the science building," Benji said with a grin that was half manic, half proud. "I could probably run the whole system from my phone if I wanted to. The hard part isn't getting in. It's timing it right so nobody cuts the feed before the good stuff plays."

"Halftime," Thorne said. Everyone looked at him. "Biggest crowd attention. Everyone's watching the field, waiting for the show. Nobody's expecting the real show to be on the screens."

Gem nodded. "That's our window. Lukas and Thorne are on the field for the first half anyway, so we can't move before that. Cody, Benji, and I position in the stands. At halftime, we slip backstage. Benji handles the tech, I run interference if needed."

She paused, pen hovering over her notebook, and turned to Cody. "And you make the speech."

Cody blinked. "Wait, me? Why me?"

"Because you're the victim," Gem said, not unkindly. "You're the one he strapped to a table. You're the one with the bruises and the story. A recording is powerful, but a face standing in front of forty thousand people saying 'this happened to me' is something else entirely."

"She's right," Lukas said quietly. His amber eyes were steady on Cody's face. "People need someone to believe in. Someone real, standin' there, tellin' the truth. That's you."

Thorne nodded. "Footage alone, they might think it's fake. Edited. You standing there makes it real."

Cody looked around the table. They were all watching him, waiting, no pressure in their faces. They were offering him a role that mattered. A chance to be more than just the guy things happened to.

"Okay," he said slowly. "Okay, I'll do it."

The tension in the room eased. Benji let out a breath. Gem made a note in her notebook.

"But I have a condition," Cody added.

Lukas's ears flicked forward. "What kind of condition?"

"Before halftime. Before any of this." Cody's hands were flat on the table, steadying himself. "I want to face him."

The room went still.

"Why?" Gem asked carefully.

"Because he made me feel like nothing." Cody's voice was steady, but anger threaded through it, building since he woke up in that cabin. "Like I was just a thing to be studied. A specimen. And I want to look him in the eye and show him that I'm still here. That I'm not afraid of him anymore."

"That's a risk," Gem said. "If he knows you're there, he might..."

"He won't do anything," Cody cut in. "Not if I do it right. The concourse, ten or fifteen minutes before kickoff. He'll be doing the rounds, pressing flesh, working the crowd. I walk up to him in front of everyone, smile, say something innocent. Nice day for football, something like that. He can't touch me. Can't even react without looking crazy."

"And if he does react?" Lukas asked, wariness creeping into his voice.

"Then we have even more witnesses." Cody leaned forward. "I'm not trying to provoke him into something stupid. I just want him to know. Before the footage plays, before his whole world falls apart, I want him to look at me and see that I'm not broken. That whatever he tried to do to me didn't work."

Gem considered this, tapping her pen against the notebook. "If he's rattled when the footage drops, he's more likely to crack publicly instead of keeping his composure." She glanced at the others. "It could actually help."

Thorne shrugged. "His choice. His risk."

Benji was grinning. "I love it. Psychological warfare. Very dramatic."

Lukas was the last to speak. His posture was tense, shoulders tight, but when he met Cody's eyes, the worry there gave way to reluctant respect. "You sure about this?"

"I'm sure."

A long pause. Then Lukas nodded. "Alright. We do it your way."

The plan was set. Benji started pulling up stadium schematics on his laptop, muttering about access points and signal boosters. Gem made lists, her handwriting small and precise. Thorne leaned back, arms crossed, watching everything with that steady focus he brought to everything.

And Cody sat there, feeling for the first time since Room B-7 like he might actually have a say in how this story ended.


The planning wound down around four, and for a while nobody knew what to do with the silence. The cabin felt different without a crisis to fill it, smaller, more real.

Benji found a deck of cards in one of the kitchen drawers, warped and sticky from humidity but still usable. "Poker?" he offered, fanning them out. "I promise I only cheat a little."

"You cheat a lot," Gem said, but she pulled up a chair anyway.

They played for chips from the bag Benji had been working through all day, which meant the stakes were literally just crumbs. Thorne won three hands in a row with a face so blank it could have been carved from stone. Benji accused him of counting cards. Thorne pointed out that you couldn't count cards in poker. Benji accused him of cheating anyway.

"He's not cheating," Gem said, tossing her cards down. "He just has the worst poker face in history, and somehow that makes him impossible to read. It's statistically infuriating."

"I'll take it," Thorne rumbled, raking in his pile of crumbs.

Lukas sat out the first few rounds, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, but Cody caught him watching the game with a half-smile he was trying to hide. After a while he pushed off and dropped into the chair next to Cody. "Deal me in."

"You any good?" Cody asked.

"Terrible." Lukas's tail wagged once. "But I like watchin' Benji lose."

"Hey!" Benji threw a chip at him. It bounced off Lukas's chest and landed on the floor. "I'm not losing, I'm strategically redistributing my assets."

The game continued. Cody lost badly, which he blamed on never having played poker with people who had ears that swiveled and tails that twitched. Benji insisted that was speciesist. Gem pointed out that Cody also just had a terrible poker face. "You do this thing with your eyebrows when you're bluffing," she said. "It's very obvious."

"I don't have a thing with my eyebrows." Cody raised both of them as high as they would go, holding the expression for a beat. "See? Completely normal."

Lukas snorted. "You absolutely do. It's kind of cute."

Cody felt his face heat and focused very hard on his cards.

The afternoon stretched into early evening, the light through the windows going gold and then orange. At some point Thorne got up and started rummaging through the kitchen cabinets, emerging with a can of beans and a dented pot that looked older than all of them combined.

"Dinner?" he offered.

"I'm not eating mystery beans the night before we take down a dean," Benji said. "What if we all get food poisoning?"

Gem was already on her phone. "There's a pizza place about twenty minutes out that delivers. We're off the grid enough, should be fine."

Two large pepperonis and a veggie later, they ate pizza out of the box, sitting around the table that was still covered in chip crumbs and scattered cards. It should have felt pathetic, five people hiding in a cabin eating delivery pizza while they planned to take down a corrupt dean. But it didn't. It felt like the family dinners Cody had stopped hoping for years ago. It felt like belonging.

After dinner, Lukas caught his eye and tilted his head toward the back door. Cody followed him out onto the small deck that overlooked the creek, the water catching the last of the sunset in flashes of copper and pink.

They stood there for a while, shoulders almost touching, listening to the water move.

"You doin' okay?" Lukas asked. "Real answer, not the one you give everyone else."

Cody thought about it. "I don't know," he said finally. "I keep waiting to feel something. Fear, anger, I don't know. But mostly I just feel tired."

"That's fair. You've earned tired."

Cody's mouth twisted, something between a grimace and a smile that didn't quite land. "Have I?"

Lukas turned to look at him, amber eyes catching the fading light. "You got kidnapped, strapped to a table, threatened, escaped, and now you're plannin' to walk up to the guy who did it and smile in his face. Yeah, Cody. You've earned tired."

Cody let out a breath that was almost a laugh. "When you put it like that."

"I put it like that 'cause it's true." Lukas's paw found his, warm and solid. "You don't gotta be brave all the time. Not with me."

"I'm not being brave. I'm just too worn out to be scared."

"Same thing, sometimes."

The creek kept moving, catching light and losing it. Somewhere inside, Benji was arguing with Gem about the proper way to shuffle cards. Thorne's low rumble cut in occasionally, settling disputes with single words.

Cody leaned into Lukas's shoulder, just a little. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For this. All of it. The pack, the cabin, the cheap pizza." He paused. "For not giving up on me when I made it really easy to."

Lukas squeezed his hand. "Wasn't ever gonna happen."

They stayed like that until the sun finished setting and the stars started coming out. Lukas's thumb traced slow circles on the back of Cody's hand, steady and unhurried, and Cody found himself thinking that maybe, when all this was over, there might be something worth staying for beyond just survival.

For a few minutes, the weight he'd been carrying felt almost manageable.


Evening settled over the cabin. The pizza boxes were stacked by the door, the cards put away, and the pack had drifted into their own corners. Benji was back on his laptop, running diagnostics. Gem had her notebook open, refining tomorrow's timeline. Lukas had gone to check on the truck, make sure it would start in the morning.

Cody found Thorne on the front porch, sitting in one of the old wooden chairs that creaked under his weight. The bear was staring out at the tree line, paws resting on his knees, taped knuckles catching the last of the light.

"Mind if I sit?" Cody asked.

Thorne tilted his head toward the empty chair. Permission granted.

They sat in silence for a while. Cody had learned by now that pushing Thorne was pointless. The bear talked when he was ready, and not a second before. So Cody watched the trees instead, listened to the creek, let the stillness stretch between them until it felt natural rather than awkward.

"You ever lose someone?" Thorne asked eventually. His voice was low, almost lost under the sound of the water.

Cody thought about his mother, the slow fade of her smile as the cancer took hold. "Yeah."

Thorne nodded, like that was the answer he'd expected. He was quiet for another long moment, and when he spoke again, his words came deliberate, each one placed like a stone in a wall.

"My dad left when I was twelve. Didn't say goodbye, didn't leave a note. Just gone one morning, like he'd never been there at all." His massive shoulders rose and fell. "Mom never talked about it. I never asked. Figured if she wanted me to know, she'd tell me."

Cody felt the weight of that settle over him. He thought about his own father, the bottles, the silence, the way absence could fill a room just as heavy as presence.

"I'm sorry," he said. The words sounded small, but they were the only ones he had.

"Spent a lot of years thinking it was my fault." Thorne's voice stayed even, but his claws had dug shallow grooves into the arm of the chair. "Thinking if I was stronger, bigger, maybe I could have made him stay. Could have held on tight enough that he couldn't leave."

"Thorne..." Cody's chest ached. He'd watched the bear move through the world like nothing could touch him, seen the way other mammals stepped aside when he walked past. To hear him talk about not being strong enough was wrong, like finding out a mountain had doubts about being tall.

"Doesn't work that way." Thorne finally looked at him, and the weariness in those dark eyes looked like it had been living there a long time. "Can't hold onto someone who wants to leave. Doesn't matter how strong you are. That's not what strength is for."

The creek kept murmuring. Somewhere in the cabin, Benji's laptop beeped twice.

"I watched that footage today," Thorne said. "The stuff Benji pulled. Graves standing over you, talking about his research, his history." His claws flexed against his knee. "Talking about that girl who lasted three days."

Cody's stomach tightened. He remembered those hours on that table, Graves's patient smile, the monologue that went on and on while Cody catalogued every detail of the room, looking for a way out.

"You didn't panic." Thorne's voice was simple, factual. "He had you strapped down, alone, telling you what he was going to do. And you just... watched. Waited. Stayed calm enough to find a way out."

"I wasn't calm. I was terrified."

"Doesn't matter. Terror makes people beg. Makes them scream, thrash, give up." Thorne shook his head slowly. "You kept your head. That's not nothing."

Cody didn't know what to say. He'd spent those hours cataloguing door timing and camera angles because it was the only thing keeping him from screaming. It hadn't felt like strength. It had been the only option that wasn't falling apart.

"That's what pack means," Thorne said. "You don't hold on too tight. You just show up. Over and over. Until showing up is the same as staying."

The door opened behind them. Lukas stepped out, saw them sitting there, and hesitated.

"You two okay?"

Thorne stood, joints popping. "Fine. Just talking." He moved past Lukas into the cabin, one massive paw briefly squeezing the wolf's shoulder as he passed.

Lukas took the empty chair, and the silence between them was different than the one with Thorne. Heavier. Cody could feel things unspoken pressing at the edges.


For a while, neither of them said anything. The creek filled the space, and somewhere inside the cabin Benji was laughing at something Gem had said. Normal sounds. Safe sounds.

"You and Thorne have a good talk?" Lukas asked finally.

"Yeah." Cody glanced at him. "He's not what I expected."

"Nobody ever is." Lukas's tail brushed against the porch boards, slow and rhythmic. "First time I met him, I thought he was gonna eat me. Turns out he just wanted to know if I had any snacks."

Cody laughed, short and surprised. "Seriously?"

"Hand to God. Big scary bear, askin' if I had any granola bars." Lukas shook his head, a small smile tugging at his muzzle. "Benji was worse. Tried to prank me with hot sauce on my first day. Didn't know wolves could smell capsaicin from across the room."

"So you've always been this paranoid."

"Cautious. There's a difference."

They sat with that for a moment. The stars were fully out now, scattered across the sky like someone had spilled salt on black velvet.

"I just..." Lukas ran a paw over his muzzle. "Someone taught me, once. To look out for people. To pay attention to back routes and safe paths and ways to keep the people you care about from getting hurt. And I've been doing it so long I forgot there's a difference between helping and hovering."

"Who taught you?"

Lukas didn't answer right away. His ears flicked back, then forward again. "Guy named Marcus. Older player, three years ahead of me. When I was a freshman, he took me under his wing. Showed me the ropes, covered for me when upperclassmen got territorial, taught me where the cameras were and which routes to take and how to survive this place." A pause. "He graduated. Moved on. Life happened. Haven't heard from him in years."

"And that's why you helped me."

"He did it for me. Felt right to pass it on." Lukas finally met his eyes. "Difference is, I'm not going anywhere. But that doesn't mean I get to decide how you fight your own battles. I know that. I do. It's just hard to turn off."

The tension in Cody's shoulders eased, just a little. "So this is you trying to turn it off?"

"This is me tryin' to figure out where the line is." Lukas's drawl thickened, the way it did when he was fighting to stay calm. "I know what I said earlier, in front of everyone. About the speech. I meant that. You're the right one to do it." He paused. "But the confrontation. Walkin' up to Graves before we drop the footage... I've been thinkin', and that's a risk I ain't comfortable with."

"You agreed to it."

"I got caught up in the moment. Everyone was there, you were fired up, and I wanted to support you." Lukas leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "But I've had time to think now. And Graves had you strapped to a table, Cody. He talked about keepin' you there for days. You wanna walk up to him with a smile and poke the bear?"

"I want him to see that I'm not afraid."

"But you are afraid. We all are. That's not weakness, that's sense." Lukas shook his head, ears pinning back. Lukas shook his head, ears flattening. "And pretendin' otherwise is how people get hurt."

Cody felt something coiling tight behind his ribs, that familiar pressure that always came before he did something stupid. "So what, I just hide until halftime? Let him think he won?"

"Nobody's talkin' about hidin'. I'm talkin' about not givin' him a heads up that we're comin' for him."

"He already knows we're coming for him!" Cody was on his feet now, pacing the small porch. "He knows I escaped, he knows the pack helped, he knows we have something planned. The only thing he doesn't know is when and how. Walking up to him doesn't change that."

"It changes everything!" Lukas stood too, and for a moment they were face to face, close enough that Cody could see the worry lines between his eyes. "You get in his face, he starts thinkin'. Starts plannin'. Maybe he pulls extra security, maybe he doesn't show up to the concourse at all. You're gamblin' the whole operation on a moment of satisfaction."

"It's not about satisfaction!"

"Then what's it about?" Lukas's voice cracked, just slightly. "Because from where I'm standin', it looks like you're tryin' to prove somethin' to yourself, and you're willin' to risk everything to do it."

The words hit harder than Cody expected. He stopped pacing, breathing hard, and for a moment all he could hear was his own heartbeat and the distant sound of the creek.

"You don't know what it was like," he said finally. His voice came out rough. "Being strapped down. Listening to him talk about me like I was already dead. Like I was just... a thing."

"I know." Lukas's voice softened. "I saw the footage, remember? I watched him standin' over you while you couldn't move."

"Then you know why I need to do this." Cody's eyes scrunched shut for a moment, jaw tight.

"What I know is that you're angry. And scared. And you're not thinkin' straight." Lukas took a step closer, and his paw landed on Cody's shoulder, warm and solid. "I've seen you when you get like this. The way you go quiet right before you blow up. You get hot, and you stop seein' the bigger picture."

Cody's hands were shaking now, that old familiar anger looking for somewhere to go.

"You don't know anything about me."

"Then tell me." Lukas's eyes held his, steady and patient. "Tell me what's really goin' on. Because this ain't just about Graves. This is about somethin' older."

The words hit too close. Cody felt a wall crack open in his chest, and behind it was heat, too much heat, clawing at his ribs like it wanted out.

"You don't get to do that." His voice came out wrong, shaking. "You don't get to dig around in my head and pretend you know what's in there."

"Cody, wait..."

"No." He stepped back, shaking Lukas's paw off his shoulder. The heat was spreading now, down his arms, into his hands. Wrong. This was wrong. "You want to know what's really going on? You want to know what I'm carrying? You're not ready for that. None of you are."

He couldn't breathe. The porch was too small and Lukas was too close and the thing inside him was clawing at his ribs like it wanted out.

He yanked open the cabin door and went inside.


The main room went still when Cody walked in.

Thorne lifted his head from the couch. Benji glanced up from his laptop. Gem emerged from the kitchen area, wiping her hands on her jeans. They all saw his face and nobody said a word.

Cody made it halfway across the room before his legs stopped working. He stood there shaking, pressure building behind his ribs until it twisted into panic.

Behind him, the porch door opened. "He needs to sit down," Lukas called out, his voice tight. "Now."

Gem moved without hesitation, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table. The gesture said everything without a word. Cody's feet carried him to it without his permission. He sat down heavily, put his elbows on the table, pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. The others gathered around him, settling into chairs, moving without crowding. Giving him space. Giving him time.

"I know about the girl you couldn't save," Cody said to his hands, the words coming out jagged, each one dragged up from somewhere deep. "I know about Benji waiting for everyone to leave. I know about Thorne's dad and Lukas's mentor who taught him to look out for people." He dropped his hands and met their eyes, one by one, jaw set, that pressure still coiled behind his ribs. "You want to know about me? Fine. You want to know what I'm carrying? I'll tell you."

Benji's quills flattened against his head. Thorne went very still. Gem's pen had stopped moving over her notebook, her ears angled forward. Lukas stood behind Cody's chair, close enough that Cody could feel the warmth of him.

"There was a guy," Cody started. His voice came out rough, like something rusted that hadn't been used in too long. "Back home. Senior year. Football teammate. Running back, same as me. We'd been competing for the starting spot all season, and he got it. I was backup. Told myself I was fine with it."

The memory was right there, vivid as a photograph. The locker room before the big game. The fluorescent lights. The smell of sweat and industrial cleaner. Guys suiting up all around them, coaches yelling about formations.

"My mom died when I was twelve. Cancer. Took about eight months from diagnosis to the end, and I watched the whole thing." Cody's hands curled on the table. "This guy, he knew. Everyone knew. Small town, word gets around."

His grip tightened. The wood of the table creaked under his fingers.

"He started talking. Loud enough for everyone to hear. About my mom. About what he'd do to her if she was still alive. The things he'd make her do." Cody's voice went flat, dead. "Detailed. Graphic. Smiling the whole time, watching my face, waiting to see what I'd do."

The room was so silent Cody could hear the creek outside, could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.

"I asked him to stop. Once. He laughed and kept going." Cody exhaled slowly. "So I stopped asking."

He could feel their eyes on him. Could feel the pressure building behind his ribs, that familiar weight, that thing that had been growing since he fell through the portal.

"I don't remember most of it. I remember the first punch. I remember him going down. And then it was just red. Noise and heat and my fists hitting something over and over until I couldn't feel my hands anymore."

His voice cracked.

"They had to pull me off. Three guys, maybe four. I don't know. I was still swinging when they dragged me away." His gaze dropped to his hands, to the white knuckles, to the way they were shaking. "They said if they hadn't stopped me, I would have killed him. And the thing is..." He swallowed hard. "The thing is, I believe them. I wasn't stopping. I couldn't stop. I didn't want to stop."

The heat was building now, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. He could feel his fingers pressing harder into the table, could feel the wood groaning, could feel something shifting under his skin that shouldn't be there.

"He was in the hospital for two weeks. Broken jaw, broken orbital, broken ribs. I got expelled. Dad had to pay off the family to keep me out of juvie." A bitter laugh escaped him. "Didn't matter. Word got around. Schools wouldn't take me, teams wouldn't touch me. I was done."

Lukas reached across and put his paw over Cody's hands. 

Cody shrugged it off. "Don't!"

Lukas came around the chair and crouched in front of him, both paws gripping Cody's shoulders, solid and warm. "Cody. Look at me."

He couldn't. If he looked up, they'd see. They'd see whatever was happening to him, whatever was wrong with him, whatever that portal had woken up or created or unleashed.

"Cody!" Lukas's grip tightened, trying to shake something loose. "Look at me!"

Cody kept his head down, eyes squeezed shut.

Lukas's paw came up under his chin, gentle but firm, lifting until Cody had no choice but to meet those amber eyes. They were steady, holding neither fear nor judgment, just that patient, stubborn care that had been there since that first day in the pine grove.

"Hey." Lukas's voice dropped, soft now. "Hey, Cody. That's what you did. It ain't who you are."

Cody's throat closed up. His eyes burned.

Gem's certain voice softly spoke up. "Tomorrow you use words. That's who you're choosing to be. That matters more."

Thorne spoke without looking up from his hands. "He said that about your mother. I understand."

Benji was watching with wet eyes, chin trembling, but he didn't look away.

A wall cracked in Cody's chest. Not the heat this time, not the anger. The thing underneath it, the thing he'd been holding together with wire and spite for years.

The tears came before he could stop them. He reached forward and grabbed Lukas, pulling him into a hug that was probably too tight, burying his face against the wolf's shoulder. Lukas didn't hesitate, wrapping his arms around Cody and holding on like he was the only thing keeping him from falling apart.

Maybe he was.

They stayed like that for a long moment, Cody's shoulders shaking, Lukas's paw steady on the back of his head. The others didn't move, didn't speak, just let it happen.

Finally, Cody pulled back, wiping his face with the back of his hand. He stared down at his fingers, the same fingers that had broken bones and ruined a life, the same hands that had wanted to keep swinging until there was nothing left to hit.

Lukas reached over and wrapped both paws around them, holding them steady.

"I don't know what's happening to me," Cody whispered. "Since I got here. There's something... I can feel it. Getting stronger."

Lukas squeezed his hands. "We'll figure it out. After tomorrow. Together."

Then he pulled Cody into another hug, and this time Cody let himself sink into it. Let himself believe, just for a second, that he wasn't alone anymore. That pack meant something. That together wasn't just a word.

When they finally separated, the others had moved closer. Thorne's massive paw landed briefly on Cody's shoulder. Benji gave him a watery smile. Gem reached across and squeezed his arm, just once.

The night settled around them, quiet and full of everything tomorrow would bring. But sitting there at that table, surrounded by people who knew the worst thing he'd ever done and had chosen to stay anyway, Cody felt a warmth in his chest that had nothing to do with anger.

Hope.

# Chapter 25: Before the Roar

Friday morning came through the cabin windows soft and slow. Cody blinked awake, aware of warmth along his back before anything else. The bed was small, barely a full, and sometime during the night Lukas had shifted closer. His arm was draped loosely over Cody's side, his breath slow and even against the back of Cody's neck.

For a few seconds, Cody didn't move. Just lay there, letting himself have this one quiet moment before everything started.

Through the open bedroom door, he could see the main room. Thorne was up, folding the blanket from the couch. Two sleeping bags lay empty near the cold fireplace. Benji sat cross-legged on his, laptop balanced on one knee, and Gem stood at the window with her arms crossed, watching the trees.

Behind him, Lukas stirred. The arm around Cody's waist tightened briefly, then relaxed.

"You awake?" Lukas's voice was rough with sleep.

"Yeah." Cody watched Thorne open a cabinet, stare into it, and close it again. The cabin didn't have much. "We should find food."

"Diner on the way in. Saw it when we drove up."

From the main room, Benji's voice cut through. "If this diner doesn't have coffee, I'm going to do something dramatic. I haven't decided what yet, but it'll be memorable."

"You'll survive," Gem said without turning from the window.

"I won't. I'll die. You'll have to explain to everyone that Benji Hartwell perished from caffeine withdrawal on the most important day of his life."

Cody felt Lukas's chest shake with a quiet laugh. He made himself sit up, already missing the warmth, and went to find his shoes.

It didn't take long to get ready. Nobody had much to pack. Benji shoved his laptop into his bag, Gem did a final sweep of the cabin to make sure they weren't leaving anything behind, and Thorne stood by the door like he was ready to physically carry anyone who moved too slow. Cody splashed water on his face in the tiny bathroom, stared at himself in the mirror for three seconds, and decided that was enough self-reflection for a morning like this.

They piled into Gem's car, Thorne folding himself into the back seat with a look of resigned suffering. The gravel crunched under the tires as they pulled away from the cabin, and Cody watched it shrink in the side mirror until the trees swallowed it up. Nobody suggested stopping at the deli from yesterday. They all wanted something different, something that didn't remind them of hiding.

Lukas spotted the diner about twenty minutes down the road, tucked between a gas station and a bait shop that looked like it hadn't seen a customer in years. The sign out front said ROSIE'S in letters that used to be red, now faded to something closer to salmon. A pickup truck and a station wagon sat in the gravel lot, both covered in a fine layer of dust.

"This looks like the kind of place that either has the best pancakes you've ever tasted or gives you food poisoning," Benji announced as Gem pulled into a spot. "No middle ground."

"Fifty-fifty odds," Thorne said from the back seat, where he'd spent the drive with his knees practically in his chest. "I'll take 'em."

The bell above the door jingled when they walked in. The inside matched the outside: worn linoleum, booths with cracked vinyl seats, a counter with red stools that had seen better decades. The smell hit Cody immediately, bacon grease and coffee and something sweet baking in the back. His stomach growled before he could stop it.

A tired-looking raccoon behind the counter looked up, did a quick headcount, and nodded toward the back corner. "Booth in the back'll fit you. Menus are on the table."

They squeezed in. Thorne took up most of one side, his shoulders pressing against the wall. Gem slid in next to him, tail curling around her feet. Cody ended up between Lukas and Benji, close enough that he could feel the warmth of Lukas's leg against his.

Benji grabbed a menu and started scanning it like he was looking for contraband. "They have something called a Lumberjack Special. Three eggs, four strips of bacon, two sausage links, hash browns, and a short stack. That's not breakfast, that's a challenge."

"That's Tuesday," Thorne said, not looking up from his own menu.

"I'm getting it." Benji slapped the menu down. "If I die, tell my laptop I loved it."

The raccoon waitress appeared with a pot of coffee and a pad, looking like she'd seen every type of customer walk through that door and stopped being surprised years ago.

Benji's eyes locked onto the coffee pot like she was carrying liquid gold. "Oh thank god. Yes. Please. Fill it to the brim. I will name my firstborn after you."

The waitress didn't blink. "It's just coffee, hon."

"It's *salvation*."

She poured, unimpressed, and pulled out her pad. They ordered. Thorne got the Lumberjack Special too, plus a side of biscuits. Gem asked for eggs and toast, practical as always. Lukas just wanted coffee and some wheat toast. Cody stared at the menu for too long before settling on scrambled eggs and bacon, his stomach too knotted to commit to anything heavier.

When the waitress left, Benji wrapped both paws around his mug like it might try to escape. "So. Game day. You know the stadium's gonna be packed, right? Like, standing room only. They've been hyping this game for weeks."

"It's the playoff decider," Lukas said. "Course it's packed."

"Right, right." Benji took a long sip, then pointed the mug at him. "And you're gonna be out there, doing your whole linebacker thing, looking scary. Meanwhile I'm gonna be in the stands, sweating through my hoodie, pretending I'm not about to..."

He caught himself, glanced around the diner. Empty except for an old badger at the counter nursing his own coffee.

"Pretending I'm not nervous," he finished. "About the game. Because sports."

"Smooth," Gem said.

Silence settled over the table for a moment. Cody could feel the tension underneath everything, the thing none of them wanted to name out loud. They'd talked it to death last night. They knew the plan. Saying it again wouldn't make it any more real.

Gem's pencil tapped against the table twice, then stopped. "So Thorne. You ever eat at a place like this before a game?"

Thorne considered the question like it had actual weight. "Once. Sophomore year. Ate a western omelet the size of my head, then threw up behind the bleachers during warmups." He paused. "Still played the whole game though."

"That's disgusting," Benji said, delighted. "I love it. Tell me more."

And just like that, the tension cracked. Thorne started talking about the game, the one against Ridgewood's rival two years back, how their center had tried to start a fight and ended up flat on his back wondering what happened. Benji interrupted every thirty seconds with questions and commentary. Gem's mouth twitched in that almost-smile she did when she was actually enjoying herself but didn't want to admit it.

The food arrived. Benji stared at his Lumberjack Special like it had personally offended him, then picked up his fork with the determination of a man going into battle. Thorne demolished his plate with methodical efficiency. Gem ate her eggs in small, precise bites, watching the rest of them with quiet amusement.

Cody picked at his bacon. Lukas's paw found his knee under the table, squeezed once, then stayed there.

"You know what I've been thinking about?" Benji said around a mouthful of hash browns. "That time Thorne got stuck in the elevator in Whitmore. You remember that? Security had to call maintenance, and he just sat in there for like two hours reading a book."

"It was forty-five minutes," Thorne said.

"It was two hours and you finished the whole book."

"It was a short book."

"It was like eight hundred pages!"

Gem nearly choked on her coffee. Lukas let out a sound that might have been a laugh if you knew what to listen for. Cody felt something loosen in his chest, some knot he hadn't realized he'd been carrying.

This was what pack meant, he thought. The hard stuff and the easy stuff, all tangled together. Terrible diner coffee and arguments about elevator incidents and Benji trying to eat more food than any hedgehog should be able to fit in his body.

He took a bite of his eggs. They were overcooked and underseasoned and somehow exactly what he needed.

They finished eating without anyone bringing up the plan again. Thorne paid the bill before anyone could argue, dropping cash on the table with a look that shut down any protests. Benji made one last desperate grab for the coffee pot before the waitress took it away, failed, and mourned loudly all the way to the parking lot.

The drive to the stadium took another hour. Gem handled the wheel with the same focused efficiency she brought to everything else, navigating the increasingly heavy traffic with minimal commentary. Benji had called shotgun before anyone else could claim it, which meant the back seat was a wall of fur and muscle that had no business being crammed into a space meant for two. Thorne sat with his knees practically at his chin, taking up half the seat by himself. Lukas was pressed against Cody so tight there wasn't a hair's width between them, and every time Gem took a turn, all three of them shifted like cargo that hadn't been tied down right.

"This is inhumane," Thorne rumbled from somewhere behind his own knees.

Benji twisted around from the front seat, where he had enough room to practically lie down. "Should've called shotgun faster, big guy."

"I will remember this."

"Worth it."

Benji turned back to his laptop, fingers flying across the screen, occasionally muttering to himself. Thorne closed his eyes, not sleeping but doing that thing bears did where they went somewhere quiet inside their own heads. Probably imagining revenge. Lukas caught Cody's eye and shrugged as much as the cramped space allowed, which wasn't much.

The stadium appeared on the horizon like a promise and a threat all at once. Cody had seen it before, that day Lukas took him on the tour, but it looked different now. Bigger. The parking lots were already filling up, cars streaming in from every direction, and even from this distance he could hear the bass thump of music playing somewhere near the tailgate area.

"Forty thousand people by kickoff," Gem said. "Give or take."

Forty thousand witnesses. The thought sat heavy in Cody's stomach alongside the eggs.

They parked in a lot reserved for players' families, thanks to some arrangement Lukas had made. Getting out of the car felt like stepping into another world. The noise hit first, a wall of sound made up of a hundred different conversations, car horns, someone's sound system blasting fight songs. Then the smell: grilled meat, beer from a dozen open coolers, the particular funk of too many people packed together in late autumn air. Early arrivals, tailgaters setting up grills and canopy tents, but already enough of a crowd to disappear into.

Lukas checked his phone. "Gotta go. Warmups in twenty."

This was it, then. The moment where they split up and the plan started for real. Cody felt something tighten in his chest.

Thorne clapped Benji on the shoulder hard enough to make the hedgehog stumble. "Don't do anything stupid."

"That's literally the whole plan," Benji said.

"Stupider than the plan, then."

Lukas stepped closer to Cody, and for a second it looked like he wanted to say something. His paw came up, hesitated, then landed briefly on Cody's arm. "See you after."

"Yeah." Cody's throat felt thick. "Go be scary."

Lukas's mouth twitched. Then he and Thorne headed toward the players' entrance, two massive shapes cutting through the crowd until the sea of fans swallowed them up.

Gem watched them go, then turned to Cody and Benji. "Alright. Let's find somewhere to wait."

They made their way through the tailgate area, weaving between grills and folding chairs and groups of fans already deep into pre-game rituals. Cody stuck close to Gem and Benji, scanning automatically, reading the crowd the way he always did. Looking for the shape of danger before it had a chance to form.

That's when he saw him.

Dean Graves stood about fifty yards away, near the main concourse entrance. He was surrounded by a small cluster of people in expensive coats, the kind of people who had buildings named after them. Donors. Board members. The dean was in full performance mode, gesturing expansively, his smile wide and warm and absolutely fake if you knew what to look for.

Cody's feet stopped moving.

He felt the pull immediately, that familiar heat flickering to life somewhere behind his ribs. Fifty yards. He could close that distance in thirty seconds. Walk right up to him, get in his face, let him see exactly who was standing there in front of all his important friends. Let him know that the subject, the data point, the opportunity had a name and a voice and wasn't afraid anymore.

"Cody." Gem's voice, sharp. She'd stopped a few feet ahead, noticed he wasn't following. "What is it?"

He didn't answer. The heat was spreading now, down his arms, into his hands. He remembered the weight of his fists, the way it felt to stop asking and start swinging. Three seconds of satisfaction before the red cleared and he saw what he'd done.

*That's what you did. It ain't who you are.*

Lukas's words from last night cut through the noise. And then Gem's, right after: *Tomorrow you use words. That's who you're choosing to be.*

Cody stood there, people flowing around him like water around a rock, and felt the heat slowly bank down to something manageable. Graves was still talking, still performing, completely unaware that the person who was about to destroy his entire world was standing fifty yards away with the means and the motive and the opportunity.

But not yet. Not like this.

This wasn't the moment. The confrontation on the concourse, the one he'd talked about last night, the one Lukas had tried to argue him out of — that would have been about anger and proving something to himself. The old Cody who didn't know any other way to fight back except with his fists.

The speech was different. The speech was about justice and evidence and forty thousand witnesses who couldn't look away.

*Tomorrow you use words.*

Today. Today he used words.

Cody turned his back on Dean Graves. The man never even looked his way, too busy charming people who would hate him by halftime.

"Come on," Cody said. His voice came out steadier than he expected. "Let's find our seats."

Gem was watching him with something sharp in her eyes. She glanced past him, toward where Graves was still holding court, then back. Her tail flicked once.

"You saw him," she said. Not a question.

"Yeah."

"And you're walking away."

"Yeah."

She studied him for another second, like she was running calculations. Then something shifted in her expression, just a fraction. "Good. That's the smart play." She turned toward the stadium entrance. "Let's go."

They pushed through the crowd toward the student section, Benji falling into step beside them. The stadium was still filling up, maybe ten thousand people scattered across the stands so far, but more streaming in every minute. By kickoff there'd be forty thousand. Forty thousand witnesses.

Cody didn't look back.

# Chapter 26: Game Day

The stadium filled around them seat by seat, section by section. What had been scattered clusters of fans when they sat down was now a solid mass of green and black, bodies pressing into seats, voices layering over each other until the noise became its own kind of weather. Vendors worked the aisles hawking hot dogs and sodas, their calls cutting through the din. Music thumped from speakers somewhere overhead, bass heavy enough that Cody could feel it in his chest.

He'd been to games before, back when he played. But never anything like this. Forty thousand seats, and it looked like every single one was going to be filled.

Beside him, Benji had his laptop balanced on his knees, fingers moving across the keyboard in short bursts between glances at the field. His leg bounced constantly, that restless energy looking for somewhere to go. On Cody's other side, Gem sat perfectly still, watching the empty field with the kind of focus she usually reserved for test results. Her tail curled around her ankles, the only sign she wasn't carved from stone.

"How long?" Cody asked.

Gem checked her phone. "Twelve minutes to kickoff."

Twelve minutes until kickoff, a couple hours until halftime, and then everything changed. One way or another.

The scoreboard flickered to life, cycling through stats and graphics. The crowd noise swelled and dipped in waves, conversations and laughter and the occasional burst of a fight song from somewhere in the student section. Cody watched a family squeeze into seats three rows down, a kit in a tiny Badgers jersey clutching a foam finger almost as big as she was.

Normal people having a normal day, no idea what was coming.

A roar started somewhere near the tunnel and spread through the stadium like a lit fuse. The speakers crackled, and a voice boomed across the field: "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome YOUR TIMBERWOOD BADGERS!"

The tunnel doors burst open. Green and black flooded out, a wall of helmets and pads and muscle, the team spreading across the field in formation. The crowd was on its feet instantly, Cody included, the noise so loud it stopped being sound and became pressure.

He scanned the numbers. 54, 71, 89... there.

Number 87. Lukas jogged out near the middle of the pack, helmet already on, jaw visible beneath the facemask. Even from this distance, Cody could see the set of his shoulders, the coiled tension in the way he moved. Thorne ran beside him, massive even among the linemen, his number 74 stretched across a back wide enough to block out the sun.

They couldn't wave, couldn't acknowledge each other at all. Lukas's eyes swept the stands once, quick, not searching for anyone specific, just taking it in. Then he was past, heading for the sideline with the rest of the defense, and Cody was just another face in forty thousand.

But he'd seen him. That was enough for now.

The anthem played, followed by the coin toss and captains meeting at midfield. Then the kicker was setting up, the crowd holding its breath, and the ball was in the air.

Kickoff.

The first quarter was a knife fight. Ridgewood scored first, a quick drive that made the crowd go quiet, then Timberwood answered with a grinding twelve-play march that ended in a field goal. The lead changed hands twice before the quarter ended, and Cody found himself leaning forward in his seat, his old instincts waking up like a muscle he'd forgotten he had.

He could read the formations, see the mismatches before they developed. When the Ridgewood quarterback dropped back on third and long, Cody knew what was coming before the ball left his hand. Screen play. The lineman in front was letting defenders through on purpose, not blocking them, which meant someone was about to catch a short pass behind all that chaos. The running back was drifting toward the sideline too casually, trying to look like he wasn't the target. Classic misdirection.

Lukas saw it too. He didn't chase the quarterback like the play wanted him to. Just read the setup, ignored the fake, and broke toward the running back before the pass even arrived. The tackle was clean and hard, two yards behind the line of scrimmage, and the crowd erupted.

But something was off. Cody watched Lukas get up, watched the way he shoved away a teammate who tried to slap his helmet. He was playing angry, hitting harder than he needed to, staying in piles longer than necessary. The coiled tension from the tunnel entrance hadn't loosened. If anything, it had gotten tighter.

"He okay?" Benji asked, not looking up from his laptop.

"I don't know."

The second quarter was more of the same, the score seesawing back and forth. Timberwood up by three, then tied, then down by four, then a touchdown made it 17-14 Badgers with two minutes left in the half. Benji's fingers never stopped moving, pulling up windows and closing them, running through whatever sequence he'd memorized. At one point he muttered "PA's clean" to no one in particular. A few minutes later: "Jumbotron feed's ready."

Gem checked her phone every thirty seconds. Cody stopped asking how long.

The clock wound down. Ridgewood tried a last-minute drive that stalled at midfield, and the halftime whistle split the air.

Gem was already standing. "Now."

---

The halftime whistle meant one thing: get off the field.

Lukas pulled his helmet off as he jogged toward the tunnel, sweat cooling on his fur in the November air. Around him, the rest of the defense was doing the same, a stream of green and black jerseys flowing toward the locker room while the marching band took the field behind them. Thorne fell into step beside him, breathing hard but steady, his massive frame blocking out the stadium lights.

"You good?" Thorne asked, low enough that only Lukas could hear.

Lukas huffed, pulling at his chin strap. "Fine."

"You're hitting like you're trying to kill someone."

"Maybe I am."

Thorne didn't push it. That was the thing about Thorne, he knew when to talk and when to just be there. They'd figure it out later, after. After whatever was about to happen in those stands, after whatever Cody was about to do. Lukas had seen Gem stand up right before the whistle, had caught that flash of movement in his peripheral vision even from fifty yards away. It was starting.

And he was stuck down here.

The tunnel swallowed them, concrete and fluorescent lights replacing sky and grass. The noise of the crowd faded to a dull roar, then disappeared entirely as they pushed through the double doors into the locker room. Coach Hendricks was already at the whiteboard, marker in hand, diagramming adjustments for the second half. Guys were peeling off pads, grabbing water, finding their lockers.

Lukas dropped onto the bench in front of his and started working on his shoulder pads. His muscles ached in that good way, the kind that meant he'd been playing hard. The score was close, 17-14, and Ridgewood wasn't gonna roll over easy. He needed to focus on the game. Needed to trust that Cody and Gem and Benji knew what they were doing up there.

Easier said than done.

"Raines."

The voice came from behind him, and Lukas didn't need to turn around to know who it was. He'd known that voice since they were six years old, running around Rumi's backyard pretending to be pro players.

"Not now, Rumi."

"Yeah, now."

Lukas turned. Rumi Castillo stood three feet away, still in full pads, helmet dangling from one hand. His eyes had that wild look, the one Lukas remembered from middle school when someone said the wrong thing and Rumi couldn't let it go. Back then it had been about respect and proving himself. Now it was about something uglier.

"I know what you're doing," Rumi said. "Hiding your little pet up in the stands. You think the Dean doesn't know? You think this is just gonna blow over?"

"Walk away."

"He's not done with this, Lukas. None of you are. And when it all comes down, I'm not gonna be the one standing in the wreckage."

Lukas stood up slowly, using every inch of his height. "You already are."

Something flickered across Rumi's face, doubt or fear or maybe both. But it got swallowed up by anger before it could take root, and his free hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of Lukas's jersey.

"You used to be somebody," Rumi hissed. "You used to matter. Now look at you. Throwing everything away for some freak who fell out of the sky."

"Let go."

"Or what? You gonna hit me? Get yourself thrown out of the game?"

The locker room had gone quiet. Lukas could feel eyes on them, the whole team watching to see what happened next. Rumi's grip tightened, knuckles pressing into Lukas's chest.

Then a shadow fell over both of them.

"He said let go."

Thorne's voice was calm, almost conversational. He'd appeared beside them without making a sound, which shouldn't have been possible for someone his size. His arms hung loose at his sides, but there was nothing relaxed about the look in his eyes.

Rumi's head snapped toward him. "This ain't your business, bear."

"It is now."

For a long moment, nobody moved. The tension in the room was thick enough to choke on, everyone holding their breath, waiting. Rumi's jaw worked, teeth grinding, and Lukas could see him calculating. Too many witnesses. Too many people who'd tell the coach exactly what happened if this went sideways.

But Rumi had never been good at math.

He let go of Lukas's jersey and swung at Thorne instead.

The punch caught Thorne square on the jaw, hard enough that his head snapped to the side. The crack echoed through the locker room, and then everything exploded at once.

"HEY! HEY!"

Two linemen grabbed Rumi from behind, hauling him back. Someone else was shouting for coach. A water bottle went flying, knocked off a bench in the chaos. Lukas felt hands on his shoulders too, teammates pulling him away even though he hadn't moved, everyone trying to separate bodies that weren't even fighting anymore.

Because Thorne hadn't swung back.

He just stood there in the middle of the chaos, perfectly still while bodies moved around him. A trickle of blood ran from the corner of his mouth, bright red against dark fur. His right hand had curled into a fist, knuckles popping, but he didn't use it. Just looked at Rumi with something that might have been pity. Then he uncurled his fist, wiped the blood from his lip with the back of his hand, and said nothing at all.

"ENOUGH!"

Coach Hendricks pushed through the knot of players, face red, veins standing out on his neck. The linemen holding Rumi let go but stayed close. Hendricks looked at Thorne's bloody lip, at Rumi's still-clenched fist, at the circle of players who'd witnessed the whole thing.

"I saw everything," Hendricks said, voice like gravel. "Castillo, you're done. Benched for the half, maybe for the season. Get out of my sight."

Rumi opened his mouth like he was going to argue, then closed it. The fight drained out of him all at once, shoulders slumping, fist finally dropping to his side. He looked at Lukas one more time, and there was something in his eyes that hadn't been there before. Something quieter than anger, rawer than defiance.

Understanding. The first crack of it, anyway. The realization that he'd just thrown away everything he'd been chasing, and for what? The Dean had offered him a path, and he'd taken it. Made his choice. And now he was standing in a locker room full of teammates who'd never look at him the same way again, and no scholarship or roster spot was going to fix that.

Rumi turned and walked to the far end of the bench, sat down, and stared at the wall.

Lukas and Thorne exchanged a look.

"You okay?" Lukas asked quietly.

Thorne shrugged, reached up to touch his jaw, winced slightly. "He hits like a kitten." Then he picked up his helmet and walked back to his locker like nothing had happened.

Coach Hendricks didn't go back to the whiteboard. He stood in the middle of the room, arms crossed, letting the silence stretch until it hurt.

"Fifteen years I've been coaching," he said, voice low and hard. "Fifteen years. And I have never, NEVER, seen someone throw away their future like that in the middle of a playoff game." He pointed at Rumi without looking at him. "You want to fight? You want to act like a damn fool? Do it on your own time. Not in my locker room. Not when we're three points up and thirty minutes away from the championship bracket."

Nobody moved, nobody breathed.

Hendricks swept his gaze across the room, making sure every single player felt it. "Anyone else got something to get off their chest? Now's the time." Silence. "Good. Then sit down, shut up, and remember why you're here."

He turned back to the whiteboard, snatched up the marker, and started diagramming with short, angry strokes. The tension in the room didn't bleed away so much as get shoved down, buried under the familiar rhythm of halftime prep. But it was still there, humming underneath everything.

Lukas grabbed his water bottle, took a long drink, and made himself focus on the whiteboard. Hendricks was adjusting the coverage on third down, shifting responsibilities, talking about Ridgewood's tendency to go to their tight end in the red zone. Lukas nodded in the right places, committed the changes to memory. This was his job. This was what he could control.

But when Hendricks paused to erase a line and redraw it, Lukas's eyes drifted to the locker room door. Just for a second. Somewhere out there, past the concrete and the tunnel and the forty thousand people in those stands, Cody was about to do something that couldn't be undone.

He hoped it was enough.

Then Hendricks was talking again, and Lukas shoved the thought down with everything else.

---

Gem was already moving before the echo of the halftime whistle faded.

"Stay close," she said, not looking back. "Don't run. Don't make eye contact. Just walk like you belong."

Cody followed her down the stadium steps, weaving through fans heading for concessions and bathrooms. Benji brought up the rear, laptop bag bouncing against his hip, quills flattened with focus. The noise of the halftime show thumped from the field behind them, drums and brass and the roar of a crowd that had no idea what was about to happen.

They hit the concourse level and Gem cut left, away from the food vendors and the merchandise stands, toward a stretch of wall that looked like nothing special. Plain concrete, a fire extinguisher, a door marked STAFF ONLY.

"Benji," Gem said.

He was already fishing a keycard from his pocket. "Cloned it off a maintenance guy last week. Should still work." He swiped it. The lock clicked red. "Or not."

"Try again."

Another swipe, red again, then green. The door popped open.

"Third time's the charm," Benji said, grinning. "Definitely charm."

They slipped through into the service corridor. The air changed immediately, stadium noise muffling behind the heavy door. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, pipes running along the ceiling.

"This is where we split," Gem said. She pointed down the corridor. "Benji, AV control is two levels up, third door on the right. You've got maybe six minutes to get the PA and Jumbotron ready."

Benji was already moving. "PA's prepped, video file's loaded, just give me six minutes."

"Six minutes," Gem repeated.

"Got it, got it." He paused, looked back at Cody. "When you're ready, say something into the mic. Anything. I'll know you're live and I'll be listening for the cue."

"What cue?"

Benji grinned, some of his usual chaos creeping back. "You'll know. Just make it dramatic." Then he was gone, footsteps echoing down the corridor until they faded.

Gem turned to Cody. "You ready?"

"No."

"Good answer." She started walking the opposite direction. "This way. Service tunnel comes out at field level, near the visiting team entrance. Should be clear during halftime."

They moved fast through the concrete maze, taking turns Gem seemed to know by instinct. The halftime show thumped above them, muffled bass making the walls vibrate. Twice they passed maintenance workers who barely glanced up from their phones.

Then Gem stopped at a door marked FIELD ACCESS - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

"This is you," she said. She pulled something from her pocket and pressed it into his hand. A wireless microphone, small and black, the kind coaches wore on the sidelines. "Benji rigged it to patch into the PA system. Soon as you turn it on, the whole stadium hears you."

Cody turned it over in his hand. Such a small thing. Such a big moment.

"I'll be watching from the tunnel," Gem said. "Soon as you're done, we move. You say what you need to say, Benji plays the footage, and we get you somewhere safe before security figures out what happened."

Cody nodded. His pulse was up, adrenaline already starting to hum through his veins, but it wasn't fear. It was the feeling he used to get before a big game. The feeling right before the play clock hit zero and everything started moving.

"Hey." Gem's paw landed on his shoulder, squeezed once. "You've got this."

"I know." He meant it. He'd been through worse than a speech. He'd survived worse than a crowd. Last time, strapped to that table, his brain had found the way out even when his body couldn't move. This time, he got to use both.

"Go get him," Gem said.

Cody pushed through the door.

The light hit him first. Stadium lights blazing down, bright enough to wash out the afternoon sky. Then the noise, the sheer wall of it, forty thousand voices and the halftime show's final crescendo mixing into something that felt less like sound and more like weather. The field stretched out in front of him, green and perfect, yard lines crisp white against the turf.

The marching band was finishing up, filing off toward the far end zone. Cheerleaders clustered near the sideline. Camera crews repositioned for the second half. Nobody was looking at him yet.

That was about to change.

Cody walked onto the field.

He made it to the forty-yard line before people started noticing. A few heads turning, then more, then whole sections of the crowd rising to their feet. The murmur started small and spread fast, confusion and shock rippling through the stands. Fingers pointing. Phones coming up. He could almost hear the questions bouncing through forty thousand minds at once: What is that? Is that a... is that a HUMAN?

Most of them had probably never seen one in real life. 

Security would be coming soon. He had maybe a minute, probably less.

He clicked the microphone on.

The PA system crackled, sharp and loud, slicing through the murmur. The crowd noise shifted, forty thousand people realizing at once that this wasn't just some streaker or halftime prank. The human had a microphone. The human was about to speak.

Cody looked out at the sea of faces. Wolves and bears and foxes and deer, thousands of them, staring back at him with expressions ranging from confusion to fear to fascination. He'd never felt so small in his life, and he'd never felt so sure of what he needed to do.

He took a breath, let it out slow, and started talking.

"My name's Cody."

His voice boomed across the stadium, echoing off concrete and steel, and the last of the halftime buzz died like someone had hit a switch. Forty thousand faces locked onto him, waiting, barely breathing.

"Week ago, I fell through a hole in the sky and landed in your woods. I didn't ask for it and I sure as hell didn't want it, but here I am."

He could see security moving now, coming from both sidelines, but they were hesitant and confused. This wasn't in the playbook. Nobody had told them what to do about a human standing at the forty-yard line talking into a microphone.

"First guy I met here was kind to me. Gave me a place to sleep, food to eat, made me feel like I wasn't alone. I started thinking maybe this place wasn't so bad."

His voice found its rhythm. The shaking in his hands steadied. This was just talking. Just telling the truth. He'd done harder things than this.

"Then I met Dean Graves."

The name landed like a stone dropped into still water. He could feel the ripple spreading through the crowd, the sudden sharpening of attention. Security had stopped moving, caught between confusion and curiosity like everyone else.

"He sat me down in his office, smiled at me, offered me candy from a little bowl on his desk. Told me he wanted to help. Told me he understood what I was going through. And I believed him. Because I wanted to."

His voice hardened without him meaning it to. He could feel his pulse in his throat, the anger trying to take over, but he kept it leashed. Controlled. This wasn't about rage. This was about truth.

"And because I believed him, I pushed away the folks who actually cared about me. The ones who'd taken me in, fed me, kept me safe. I called them liars. I walked right into his hands."

He let that sit for a beat. Owning it. Then he kept going.

"And what did I get for trusting him? He threatened the folks who'd taken me in. Told them their scholarships, their academic careers, everything they'd worked for would disappear unless they handed me over."

His grip on the microphone tightened, but he kept his voice steady.

"So I went to talk to him. Face to face. Thought maybe I could reason with him, protect the folks who'd been protecting me. And you know what I got? Sedated and hauled away like cargo."

He let that land before continuing.

"I woke up strapped to a table in a room in the basement of the science building. And that same man who offered me candy stood over me with a clipboard and told me exactly what he was gonna do. Every test. Every sample. Every way he was gonna cut me open to get his name in a journal."

Silence now. The kind of silence that happens when forty thousand people stop breathing at the same time.

"He told me I wasn't the first. That other people fell through before me. That one of them died on that table, and he buried it. No authorities. No investigation. Just gone."

Cody paused. Let that sink in. Then he felt something shift in his chest, the nervous energy transforming into something else. Something that felt almost like confidence. Former captain energy, Thorne might have called it. The feeling of standing on a field with everyone watching and knowing exactly what to do next.

"Now, I could stand here and tell you what kind of man Victor Graves really is." He turned toward the Jumbotron, arm sweeping up in a gesture that felt natural now, like calling a play. "But I think it's better if you hear it from him."

He pointed at the massive screen.

"Roll it!"

The Jumbotron flickered, went dark for half a second, and then Room B-7 filled the screen. Forty feet tall, bright as daylight, impossible to miss. The concrete walls, the equipment racks, the table with straps hanging loose. And standing in the middle of it all, a snow leopard in a lab coat, silver-white fur immaculate, pale blue eyes fixed on something off-camera.

On Cody. Strapped down and helpless.

The audio crackled through the stadium speakers, clear as a bell.

"Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name."

Graves's voice, soft and clinical and utterly damning, echoed across forty thousand stunned faces. The footage kept rolling. The sampling kit. The clipboard. The casual discussion of tissue extraction and resonance mapping while Cody lay there unable to move.

Phones came out everywhere. Thousands of tiny screens lighting up, recording, capturing. The evidence playing on an endless loop while the crowd watched in horror.

Cody lowered his arm. The Jumbotron kept playing, but he wasn't watching anymore. He was looking toward the press box, toward the donor suites, searching for a flash of silver-white fur.

He didn't have to search long.

Graves was already coming down. Moving fast through the crowd near the stairs, security trailing behind him, that careful composure cracking with every step. Even from this distance, Cody could see it. The mask slipping.

Good. Let him come. Let everyone see what happened next.

Cody stood at the forty-yard line and waited.

---

Graves reached him in under a minute.

The Dean's fur was disheveled, his suit jacket askew, his carefully maintained composure hanging by threads. Security flanked him on both sides, but they weren't restraining him. Not yet. These were his people. His loyalists. They'd escorted him down, not held him back.

The Jumbotron still played the footage on loop behind them. Forty feet of evidence, impossible to ignore.

"You don't understand what you've done."

The voice was soft, clinical, trying to reclaim control. But Cody could hear the cracks underneath. He could also hear Graves's words echoing back from the stadium speakers, the mic in his hand still live, still broadcasting. Graves either didn't notice or didn't care.

"I understand exactly what I've done."

Graves stepped closer, and Cody held his ground. Around them, the stadium had gone quiet again, everyone watching, everyone recording, everyone waiting to see what happened next.

"That footage is out of context," Graves said, voice still controlled but tight around the edges. "You're confused. Traumatized. I was trying to help you, to understand what you ARE. Do you have any idea what your existence means to science? To this entire world?"

"I know what it meant to you."

Something flickered in those pale blue eyes. The mask slipping, just a little.

"I gave you shelter. I gave you answers. I was going to make you SIGNIFICANT." Graves's claws started to curl, the professional veneer cracking. "And this is how you repay me? By destroying everything I've built? Do you know what you've cost this university? What you've cost ME?"

Cody felt his hands wanting to curl into fists. The old familiar pressure, the one that used to mean fists flying and consequences later. His body wanted to move, to hit, to make Graves feel even a fraction of what he'd felt strapped to that table.

But he stayed planted. Kept his voice steady.

"You strapped me to a table."

"FOR SCIENCE!" The softness was gone now, Graves's voice rising, and the words boomed back from the stadium speakers a half-second later, forty thousand witnesses hearing the Dean of Academic Affairs screaming justifications for human experimentation. A ripple of shock went through the crowd. Someone in the stands yelled something Cody couldn't make out. "For knowledge that would have changed everything! Fifteen years I've waited, FIFTEEN YEARS, and you just... you just..."

"You're scared, aren't you?"

Graves stopped. The words hit him like a slap, cutting through the spiral.

"What?"

"Not of me," Cody said quietly. Every word landing like a hammer. "Of being nobody again. Fifteen years of waiting, and this was supposed to be your legacy. Your name in the journals. Your face at the conferences. But you're not gonna get it. Because I'm not your subject. I'm not your data. I'm just a guy who fell through a hole in the sky."

He let that sit for a beat. Then:

"And I've got folks who actually give a damn about me. What do you have?"

The crack happened all at once.

Graves's face twisted, something ugly and raw surfacing from underneath all those years of careful control. His claws extended fully, his lips pulled back from his teeth, and he lunged. Not calculated, not measured, just pure desperate rage, reaching for Cody like he could somehow take it all back if he could just get his paws around the human's throat.

Cody didn't flinch, didn't move. Just watched him come.

Security grabbed Graves before he got there. Two of them, hauling him back by the arms, but everyone had already seen. Every phone in the stadium had already captured the Dean of Academic Affairs lunging at a student on the forty-yard line. The crowd erupted, gasps and shouts and a growing roar of disbelief. Somewhere in the stands, someone was booing. Then more joined in.

"You're NOTHING!" Graves was shouting now, all pretense abandoned, thrashing against the guards holding him, his words still echoing through every speaker in the stadium. "You hear me? NOTHING! I made you MATTER! Without me you're just another accident! Another piece of DEBRIS!"

The boos were spreading now, rolling down from the upper decks like thunder. Forty thousand people watching a man they'd trusted, a man who'd shaken their hands at fundraisers and smiled at them in hallways, completely fall apart.

Cody didn't respond. Just stood there, hands at his sides, and watched them drag him away.

The mask wasn't slipping anymore. It was gone. Shattered into pieces on the field in front of everyone who'd ever believed in him.

Gem appeared at his elbow, crossing from the tunnel entrance. Benji was jogging across the field from somewhere near the press box, laptop bag bouncing. The crowd noise was shifting now, the boos fading into something else. Someone started clapping. Then more. It spread through the stands in uneven waves, not the thunderous roar of a touchdown but something quieter, more uncertain. Applause for a moment no one had expected to witness.

Cody raised the mic one more time.

"Thanks for listening."

He clicked it off. The applause swelled briefly, then began to settle as forty thousand people tried to process what they'd just witnessed.

"You okay?" Gem asked finally.

Cody thought about it. His hands had stopped shaking. The tension that had been coiled in his shoulders all day had finally let go.

"Yeah," he said. "I think I am."

---

They didn't get to stand there long.

A badger in a university polo pushed through the crowd of staffers and media that had started gathering near the tunnel entrance, a security escort flanking him on both sides. His name tag read CAMPUS OPERATIONS but his expression said something closer to damage control.

"You." He pointed at Cody. "Come with me."

Gem stepped forward, putting herself between them. "He's not going anywhere without us."

The badger looked like he wanted to argue, but something in Gem's eyes made him reconsider. He glanced at the security guards, then back at the three of them, then at the crowd of people still recording on their phones.

"Fine. All of you. Now."

They followed him through the tunnel and into a conference room tucked behind the athletic offices. The walls were lined with team photos and championship banners, and a long table dominated the center of the space. Two more officials were already waiting inside, a deer in a blazer who introduced herself as Associate Dean Morrison and a wolf in campus security uniform who didn't introduce himself at all.

The badger shut the door. "Who are you? What the hell was that out there?"

Cody opened his mouth to answer, but Morrison held up a hoof.

"Wait." She was looking at her phone, scrolling through something. The footage, probably. It was already everywhere. "Before you say anything, I need to understand what we're dealing with here." She looked up at Cody, and her expression had shifted from confusion to something more careful. "What did Dean Graves do to you?"

Cody told them. The short version, at least. Office 412. The candy bowl. The email threatening his friends. Waking up strapped to a table in a basement room. The things Graves had said while standing over him with a clipboard.

"The email," Gem said, already pulling out her phone. "I still have it. Sent to my campus account." She handed it to Morrison, who read it with the security wolf looking over her shoulder.

*Have the human come to Office 412. Alone. By 5 PM.*

*I'd hate for your academic standing to be affected by any... misunderstandings about unauthorized system access. And I'm sure Mr. Raines would prefer his scholarship review to proceed without complications.*

Morrison's expression hardened as she read. "He put this in writing?"

"Signed it too," Gem said. "Warm regards, Dean Victor Graves."

Nobody interrupted after that. By the end, Morrison's face had gone pale under her fur.

"The footage," she said slowly. "That's all real? That room, that equipment, that's on this campus?"

"Room B-7," Cody said. "Sublevel of the science building."

Morrison and the badger exchanged a look that said entire careers are about to end over this. The security wolf was already on his radio, speaking in low tones.

She stood, straightening her blazer. "We'll need a full statement, but that can wait until tomorrow. Monday morning, my office, nine AM. Bring your friends." She paused at the door. "Tonight, just... watch the game. You've earned that much."

Then she was gone, the badger and the wolf following, and Cody was left standing in the conference room with Gem and Benji.

"Well," Benji said after a moment. "That went better than expected."

Gem shot him a look.

"What? I was ready for handcuffs. This is a win."

They made their way back to the field. The second half was about to start, players jogging back onto the turf, the crowd noise building again as people tried to process what they'd just witnessed while also remembering there was still a football game happening. The Jumbotron had finally stopped playing the footage, replaced by the normal game graphics and sponsor logos.

Cody found a spot on the sideline, just behind the team bench, close enough to see the field but out of the way of the coaches and trainers moving back and forth. Gem stood on one side of him, Benji on the other. They didn't say anything. They didn't need to.

The defense took the field first. Cody scanned the jerseys until he found number 87, Lukas lining up at his position, helmet on, shoulders set. He looked the same as he had in the first half, focused and intense, but something was different. Cody could see it in the way he held himself, a tension that hadn't been there before.

Then Lukas turned.

He wasn't scanning the stands this time, just turning like he knew exactly where to look, and his eyes found Cody on the sideline, ten feet away.

The moment lasted maybe two seconds. Lukas's face was hidden behind his helmet, but Cody could feel the weight of that look. I see you. You made it. Now let me finish this.

Cody nodded, small, just enough to say he understood.

Lukas turned back to the field. And something in his posture changed, a looseness that hadn't been there before, like a weight had lifted off his shoulders.

The whistle blew. The second half started.

The third quarter was a grind. Both teams traded punts, neither offense finding any rhythm, the defenses locked in a war of attrition. Timberwood's lead held at three points, then Ridgewood tied it with a field goal, then Timberwood went back up by four on a short touchdown run. The crowd was on its feet for every play, the earlier chaos fading into the background as the game took over.

Cody watched it all from the sideline, his old instincts firing in ways they hadn't in almost three years. He could read the formations, see the mismatches, predict the plays before they developed. When Ridgewood's quarterback changed the play at the last second, Cody knew it was a short pass before the ball was even snapped. When Timberwood's offense bunched up tight on a crucial third down, he knew they were going to pound it straight ahead.

Football had been his whole life once. Before the incident, before everything fell apart. Standing here, close enough to hear the coaches calling plays and the players shouting adjustments, it felt like reconnecting with a part of himself he'd thought was gone.

The fourth quarter started with Ridgewood driving. They scored on a long march that ate up six minutes of clock, taking the lead 28-24. Timberwood answered with a field goal, cutting it to one. Then Ridgewood got the ball back with four minutes left.

Three minutes left, then two. Ridgewood running the ball on every play, trying to bleed the clock dry.

Cody watched the offensive line, the way one of the blockers was leaning before each snap, telegraphing the direction of the run. They're setting something up, his brain said. Trying to sucker the defense into overcommitting.

On the field, Lukas was reading the same thing. Cody could see it in the way he shifted his weight, refusing to take the bait.

The ball snapped.

The running back took the handoff and followed his blockers toward what looked like an open lane on the right side. But Lukas didn't bite. He cut the other direction, found the real gap, and met the runner before he'd taken two steps. The collision was loud enough to hear from the sideline.

The ball popped loose.

For one frozen moment, everyone just stared at it bouncing on the turf. Then Lukas was there, scooping it up in stride without breaking momentum, and suddenly he wasn't a defender anymore. He was a runner with nothing but open field ahead of him.

Timberwood ball. Forty-two yards from the end zone. And Lukas was already moving.

A defender grabbed at his jersey and missed. Another came in for the tackle and Lukas spun through it, still on his feet, still moving. The forty-yard line, then the thirty, the crowd noise hitting a pitch Cody felt in his teeth, in his bones, in every part of him. The twenty, a defender diving and getting nothing but air. The ten, Cody screaming something he didn't know what, his voice lost in the roar of forty thousand people. The five.

Lukas crossed the goal line and the scoreboard flipped: BADGERS 33, RIDGEWOOD 28. The clock hit zero half a second later.

The stadium exploded.

---

Cody didn't remember pushing through the crowd that flooded onto the field. He didn't remember shoving past reporters and cameras and delirious fans. He just remembered finding Lukas in the middle of the chaos, helmet off, fur matted with sweat, and then they were hugging, Lukas's arms crushing him against that massive chest while people screamed and confetti fell from somewhere and the scoreboard flashed BADGERS WIN over and over.

"You did it," Cody said into Lukas's shoulder. "Holy shit, you actually did it."

Lukas pulled back just enough to look at him. His eyes were wet, and Cody couldn't tell if it was sweat or tears or both. "I saw you on the sideline. When I turned around and you were just there." He shook his head. "I knew. Whatever happened, whatever you did, I knew you were okay."

"I'm okay," Cody said. "We're okay."

Then Thorne was there, lifting both of them off the ground in a bear hug that made Cody's ribs creak. Benji was bouncing around them like a kid on Christmas morning, quills practically vibrating with excitement. And Gem was standing a few feet away, arms crossed, trying to look unimpressed, but the smile tugging at the corner of her mouth gave her away.

The pack. His pack. All of them together on a football field while the world celebrated around them.

Cody let himself feel it, the victory and the relief and the bone-deep exhaustion that came from finally, finally being done with hiding and running and being afraid.

Monday there would be statements and investigations and probably a lot of uncomfortable questions. Monday they'd have to deal with whatever came next. But tonight? Tonight a dean was in custody, a wolf had just run forty-two yards for the win, and Cody was standing on a football field with people who'd risked everything to keep him safe.

Tonight they'd won.

All of it.

# Interlude: The Fall

The shredder made a sound like teeth grinding.

Victor Graves fed another stack of papers into the slot and watched fifteen years of research turn into confetti. Subject files. Protocol notes. Observation logs. All of it, gone in seconds, reduced to strips of nothing that piled up in the bin below.

His office door was open. It was always open. That was the Victor Graves brand, the signature move that had defined his tenure as Dean. My door is always open. Come in anytime. I'm here for you. A generation of students and faculty had walked through that door believing they were meeting a mentor, an ally, a friend. None of them had ever understood that the open door wasn't an invitation. It was a trap. A way to keep everyone visible, everyone accessible, everyone where he could see them coming.

Now the door hung open on an empty hallway, and Victor couldn't bring himself to close it.

His phone buzzed on the desk. He glanced at the screen. Chancellor Morrison. The fourth call in ten minutes. He let it ring through to voicemail, the same way he'd let the previous three go. The same way he'd let the calls from Legal go, from the Provost, from Campus Security. They all wanted to talk. They all wanted explanations. They all wanted to figure out how to handle this, how to contain it, how to make it go away.

None of them understood. There was no containing this. The footage was everywhere. Every phone in that stadium had recorded it, uploaded it, shared it before halftime was even over. His face was on every screen in the state by now, probably the country, his voice playing on loop: Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name.

The shredder jammed. Victor cursed and yanked at the paper, tearing it, fingers trembling as he tried to clear the teeth. His paws weren't steady anymore. Hadn't been since security had driven him back here from the stadium, since they'd walked him into his own building without a word and left him alone in his office like a prisoner in a holding cell.

He got the shredder running again and fed it another stack. Personnel records. Research grants. The documentation for Room B-7 that he should have destroyed years ago but had kept because he'd thought he might need it someday, might need proof of what he'd accomplished when the world finally recognized his work.

The world was recognizing it now.

His phone buzzed again. This time the screen showed a different name: VICTOR. His son. Victor Jr., who he hadn't spoken to in almost two years, who had stopped returning calls somewhere around the third missed birthday, who had finally given up on a father who was always too busy, always too focused, always chasing something more important than family dinners and graduation ceremonies and all the small moments that added up to a life.

Victor let that call go to voicemail too.

On the wall behind his desk, his diplomas hung in their frames, the gold lettering catching the fluorescent light. PhD in Xenobiology. Advanced Research Fellowship. Distinguished Faculty Award. Fifteen years of credentials, fifteen years of proof that he mattered, that he was somebody, that his name meant something in the halls of academia.

Beside the diplomas, a row of photographs he hadn't looked at in years. His wedding day, both of them young and smiling, before the long hours and the missed anniversaries and the slow erosion of everything that wasn't work. Victor Jr. as a cub, sitting on his father's shoulders at some campus event, his small paws gripping the fur on Victor's head. A family portrait from a decade ago, all three of them posed and stiff, the kind of photo you put on a wall and forget to dust.

The frames were dusty now. He could see it from here, the thin film covering the glass, proof of how long it had been since he'd done anything but glance past them on his way to something more important.

The shredder kept grinding. The bin was almost full.

Footsteps in the hallway. Multiple sets, heavy and deliberate, the kind of footsteps that didn't belong to students or faculty.

Victor looked up.

A Bengal tiger filled the doorway, massive and striped, wearing the uniform of University Oversight. Two more officers flanked him, wolves in tactical gear, their expressions professionally blank. Behind them, two campus security guards that Victor recognized, the same ones who had driven him here from the stadium. They wouldn't meet his eyes.

"Victor Graves." The tiger's voice was flat. "Step away from the desk."

Victor's paw hovered over the shredder's feed slot, one last stack of papers clutched in his grip. Evidence. Proof. Everything they would need to bury him.

"I'm the Dean of Academic Affairs," he said. The words came out wrong, too high, too desperate. "I have rights. I have tenure. You can't just walk into my office and..."

"Victor Graves." The tiger stepped into the room, and suddenly the space felt very small. "You are under arrest by the authority of Timberwood Hollow for kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault, illegal experimentation on a sentient being, conspiracy, abuse of institutional authority, and accessory to the death of Subject TH-2010-003."

The papers slipped from Victor's fingers.

"Turn around. Hands behind your back."

Victor turned. The metal was cold against his wrists, the click of the cuffs loud in the quiet office. One of the wolves gathered the fallen papers, the unshredded evidence, everything Victor hadn't managed to destroy in time.

The tiger glanced at the shredder, still running, the bin overflowing with confetti. "Add destruction of evidence to the list."

"Let's go."

They walked him out of his office, past his nameplate on the door. VICTOR GRAVES, Ph.D. Dean of Academic Affairs. The brass plate he'd polished himself when he'd first been appointed, the title he'd spent his whole career chasing. Down the hallway of Whitmore Hall, the same hallway he'd walked a thousand times, ten thousand times, always with purpose, always with authority, always knowing that everyone who saw him knew exactly who he was and what he meant to this institution.

Students were gathered at the end of the hall. Word traveled fast on a college campus, even faster when the news was this big. They parted as the officers approached, pressing against the walls to make room, and Victor could feel their eyes on him. Phones came up. Screens glowing, cameras pointed, everyone recording.

"Holy shit," someone whispered. "Is that..."

"That's the Dean. That's Dean Graves."

"He's in handcuffs."

Victor kept his eyes forward, but he could hear the whispers spreading, could feel the weight of all those stares, all those lenses, all those witnesses who would share this moment with everyone they knew.

Faculty had gathered too. Colleagues he'd worked with for years, professors who had sat in his meetings and laughed at his jokes and competed for his approval. Dr. Whitmore from Chemistry. Professor Santos from Biology. The department heads he'd mentored, promoted, shaped into allies. They watched him pass in silence, and not one of them looked away.

The lobby of Whitmore Hall was worse.

A television mounted on the wall was tuned to a local news channel, and Victor's face filled the screen. Not a photo, not a headshot, but the footage. The footage from Room B-7, the footage he'd never imagined anyone would see, playing on a loop while a news anchor's voice provided commentary he couldn't quite hear over the blood rushing in his ears.

"Every journal that rejected me will be begging to print my name."

His own words, echoing back at him as he was led through the building in handcuffs.

The front doors of Whitmore Hall loomed ahead. Glass and steel, the same doors he'd walked through on his first day as Dean, the same doors he'd walked through every morning for fifteen years, always in control, always knowing exactly where he stood and what he was building.

The tiger pushed them open.

Outside, the November air hit Victor's face, cold and sharp. More cameras waited on the steps, news crews who had arrived while he was being processed, reporters shouting questions he couldn't parse through the ringing in his head.

The man who had wanted his name in every journal was about to get his wish.

Just not the way he'd planned.

The doors of Whitmore Hall swung shut behind him, and Victor Graves, former Dean of Academic Affairs, was walked down the steps toward a waiting patrol car while the whole world watched.

# Chapter 27: The Ledge

The celebration lasted for over an hour.

Cody lost track of how many people hugged him, slapped his back, shouted things he couldn't hear over the noise. Players he'd never met were grabbing his shoulders and yelling "That was INSANE!" Reporters tried to get close but security kept pushing them back, and somewhere in the chaos Coach Hendricks found him and just stared for a long moment before shaking his hand and walking away without a word.

The pack stayed close. Thorne appointed himself unofficial bodyguard, his massive frame clearing a path through the crowd whenever things got too intense. Benji was everywhere at once, bouncing between conversations, showing people something on his laptop, practically glowing with the kind of energy that came from pulling off the impossible. Gem kept to the edges, watching, but every time Cody caught her eye she gave him a small nod that said more than words would have.

And Lukas. Lukas stayed at his side as long as he could, close enough that their shoulders kept brushing, not saying much but always there. Every few minutes someone would pull him away for a photo or a handshake or a shouted congratulation on the game-winning play, and every time he'd drift back to where Cody was standing like it was the only place he wanted to be.

Eventually Coach Hendricks shouted something about showers and film review, and the team started flowing toward the tunnel. Lukas hesitated, looking at Cody.

"Go," Cody said. "I'm not going anywhere."

Thorne caught Lukas's eye and tilted his head toward the tunnel.

Lukas nodded once, then jogged after his teammates, Thorne falling into step beside him, their numbers vanishing into the crowd of green and black.

The pack waited on the field while the team cleaned up. Benji sat cross-legged on the turf, laptop balanced on his knees, muttering about upload speeds and server traffic. Gem stood with her arms crossed, watching the stands empty, but she looked more relaxed than Cody had ever seen her.

"Hell of a day," she said.

"Yeah." Cody sat down on the bench nearby. "Hell of a day."

Twenty minutes later, Lukas and Thorne emerged from the tunnel, both in civilian clothes, fur still damp from the shower. Lukas wore jeans and a flannel, sleeves rolled to the elbows, gym bag slung over his shoulder. Thorne had on sweats and a Timberwood t-shirt stretched tight across his massive chest. They looked different out of their gear. Smaller, somehow. More like the guys Cody had gotten to know than the wolves and bears who'd just won a playoff game.

The crowd had thinned to almost nothing by then. Parents collecting their kids, fans heading for the parking lots, the maintenance crews starting their slow sweep through the stands. The Jumbotron went dark. The scoreboard stayed lit a while longer, BADGERS 33, RIDGEWOOD 28 glowing against the night sky, before someone finally switched it off.

The stadium lights started clicking off section by section, plunging the stands into darkness. A few maintenance crews moved through the aisles picking up trash, their flashlights bobbing like fireflies in the distance.

Cody stood near the tunnel entrance with the pack, all of them tired and wired and not quite ready to leave. Thorne had his arm around Benji's shoulders, the porcupine's energy finally starting to fade into something closer to exhaustion. Gem stood apart, arms crossed, but she hadn't stopped smiling since they'd walked off the field.

"We should head back," she said finally. "It's late. And some of us have statements to give on Monday."

"Buzzkill," Benji muttered, but he was already yawning.

Thorne stretched, his massive frame blocking out what was left of the light. "Food," he said, already heading toward the parking lot.

"Always," Benji said.

Gem glanced at Lukas, then at Cody. Something flickered in her expression, there and gone. "You two coming?"

Lukas shook his head. "We'll catch up. I want to show Cody something first."

Gem's eyes narrowed for just a second, then softened. She nodded once, turned, and started walking. Thorne and Benji followed, their voices fading into the dark.

Then it was just the two of them, standing on the empty field where everything had happened.

Lukas turned to face him. The stadium lights were almost all off now, just a few security floods casting long shadows across the turf. In the dim light, his amber eyes caught what was left of the glow.

"There's a place I go sometimes," he said. "When I need to think. When everything gets too loud." He paused. "I'd like to show you. If you want."

If you want.

Not follow me or come on or any of the other commands Cody had gotten used to over the past week. Not Lukas grabbing his arm and pulling him somewhere safe. Just an invitation, offered with an open hand.

Cody had spent his whole life being led. By coaches, by his father, by circumstances he couldn't control. Following because he didn't know what else to do, because the path was already laid out, because fighting it was harder than going along.

This was different. This was a choice.

"Yeah," he said. "I'd like that."

---

They passed through a gate Lukas unlocked with a key from his pocket, down a concrete corridor beneath the stands, and through an unmarked door that opened onto a narrow stairwell. The metal rungs of a maintenance ladder were cold under Cody's hands as he climbed, the November air biting at his fingers, but he didn't stop until he pulled himself onto a flat concrete roof above the press box.

The view hit him like a fist to the chest.

The stadium stretched out below them, dark and silent, the stands empty, the field a black rectangle under the stars. And above, the sky was thick with more stars than Cody had ever seen back home, where light pollution swallowed everything. No city glow here, no haze, just an endless scatter of light against the dark.

"Damn," he breathed.

Lukas climbed up after him and dropped onto his back, arms folded behind his head. "Found this spot sophomore year. After the knee surgery, when I couldn't sleep. I'd come up here and just look up. Nobody knows about it."

"Until now."

Lukas turned his head, met Cody's eyes in the dark. Something passed between them, quiet and sure.

"Until now."

Cody lay down beside him. The concrete was cold and hard against his back, but he didn't care. From up here, the world felt very far away. The Dean, the footage, the speech, all of it seemed like it belonged to someone else, some other version of him from hours ago.

They lay there in silence for a while, just breathing, just existing.

"Can I tell you something?" Cody said.

Lukas's ear flicked toward him. "Shoot."

Cody stared at the stars. He'd known this was coming. Maybe he'd even wanted it to.

"There was a guy," he said. "Brian. We called him Briar sometimes because of this stupid joke about a rabbit patch that doesn't matter now." He swallowed. "We were together for two years. The kind of thing where you start planning a future without realizing you're doing it."

Lukas didn't move. Just listened.

"He had a motorcycle. Loved that thing more than anything except maybe me." Cody kept his voice flat, easier that way. "One night he went out for a ride. Truck ran a red light. He survived, but the head trauma was bad. When he woke up, he didn't know who I was. Didn't know who he was. Total memory loss."

Lukas's breath caught. "Cody..."

"I stayed. For months. Visited every day, helped with recovery, tried to be there." He laughed, but there was nothing funny in it. "He never remembered. Not me, not us, not any of it. Eventually his family moved him to a facility upstate. I got a letter from his mom thanking me for my help." He paused. "That was it."

The wind cut across the empty stadium below, a low hum through the stands.

"He's still out there somewhere," Cody said. "Living some life that doesn't include me. But the guy I loved? He's gone. Has been for years." He exhaled. "That's one of my ghosts."

Lukas turned his head. "One of them?"

Cody kept his eyes on the sky. "Remember that night on the bench? When I told you about my mom, the pancakes, the lake?" He swallowed. "There's something I didn't tell you. About my dad. About what happened after she died."

Lukas was watching him. Waiting.

"I told you something in him broke. That he started drinking, couldn't look at me without seeing her." Cody's fingers traced the cold concrete. "What I didn't say was where all that grief went. All that anger." He swallowed hard. "He needed somewhere to put it. I was right there."

The wind picked up, sharp against his face.

"He broke one of my ribs when I was fifteen. Told the ER I fell off my bike." Cody shrugged, a small, tight motion. "After that I learned to stay out of his way. Kept my head down, counted the days until I could leave." He finally looked at Lukas. "So yeah. That's why I'm not exactly homesick."

Lukas's eyes were dark, unreadable. When he spoke, his voice was low. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It's done." Cody turned back to the stars. "That night, before Gem's text came through, you asked me what I'd tell my mom if I could go back one more time. I was about to answer."

"What were you going to say?"

Cody was quiet for a moment. "That I found people who give a damn." He turned his head, met Lukas's eyes. "But that was before. Before Graves, before that room, before you ran through a wall to get to me." His voice dropped. "Now I'd tell her I found someone worth staying for."

Silence stretched between them. Then Lukas shifted, moved closer until their shoulders touched.

"At the cabin," Lukas said quietly, "I told you that you were pack. That you don't get to trade yourself for us."

Cody turned his head.

"But standin' on that field today, waitin' for you to walk out there..." Lukas's voice roughened. "I realized I was lyin' to myself. Pretendin' it was just about pack. Just about keepin' you safe." He let out a breath. "When I turned around after that play and you were just there, ten feet away, alive, after everything... I knew it was more than that. Has been for a while."

His paw found Cody's hand in the dark, warm and solid.

"I ain't good at this part," Lukas said. "The words. But I need you to know. Whatever this is between us, I'm not runnin' from it anymore."

Cody's heart was doing something strange in his chest. He was tired of pretending he didn't know what it meant.

"I'm not going to lie to you." Cody swallowed. "I'm getting butterflies in my gut. They started in the woods when you found me. Got worse in the tunnels, on that walk, every time you put yourself between me and something dangerous." He paused. "And at the cabin, when I told you all the worst thing I ever did, and you looked at me and said 'that's what you did, it ain't who you are'..." His voice caught. "That's when I knew. Tonight just made it impossible to ignore anymore." He let out a breath. "They come out every time I hear you speak, Lukas. Every single time."

Lukas went still beside him. "Butterflies bite hard," he said, voice low. "Tell me where they sting."

Cody finally turned his head, met those amber eyes. "I'm going to talk plain. I'm falling for you, bud." He swallowed. "The people I've loved have a way of disappearing. One forgot me, one turned into someone I didn't recognize, one I had to bury. So I need to know, and I'm sorry if it sounds like an ultimatum, but with everything that's happened, I need something solid."

A cold gust swept across the roof. Cody's voice stayed steady, even if his hands weren't.

"If you say no, I won't be angry and I won't make it awkward. It'll be like it's been. But if it's yes..." He paused. "I'm willing to take it slow. See where it goes." He turned back to the stars. "Your move."

Silence stretched between them. Cody could hear Lukas's breathing, could feel the warmth radiating off his fur even with the November chill pressing up from below.

Then Lukas shifted. Moved closer until their knees touched.

"Cody." His voice cracked. He cleared his throat, forced it steady. "I'm not good at soft landings. But I feel the same pull. Been fighting it since the woods, and losin' that fight a little more every day. The tunnels. The cabin. That night you told us everything and I realized I'd follow you anywhere." He let out a breath. "By the time I broke down that door in B-7, I wasn't even pretendin' anymore."

Cody's heart slammed against his ribs.

"No ultimatum," Lukas said. "No pressure. Just us, this ledge, these stars." His paw squeezed Cody's hand. "We already did slow, Cody. We already did careful. I think we earned this." He squeezed again. "Yes. I'm right here. I ain't goin' anywhere."

Something broke open in Cody's chest, not painful, just release. He felt a tear slide down his temple before he could stop it.

"Yeah," he managed. "Yeah, we did."

Lukas rolled toward him, pulled him in until Cody's forehead rested against the thick fur of his neck. "Still here," he rasped. "Both of us. After all of it."

Cody held on. Let himself be held. The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and ancient, but right now they felt like witnesses.

When he finally pulled back, Lukas's thumb brushed the tear from his cheek, fur soft against skin.

"That one's mine," he murmured. "I'll keep it."

Cody laughed, wet and broken. Then he leaned in and kissed him.

He kissed Lukas like he'd been waiting his whole life and didn't want to wait another second. Like every wall he'd ever built had finally come down. Lukas made a sound deep in his chest, something between a growl and a gasp, and pulled Cody closer. Cody's fingers found the thick fur at the back of his neck and held on.

The world went away. The roof, the stadium, the whole damn week. There was just warmth and pressure and the taste of something he'd been too scared to name until right now. Lukas kissed him back like he meant it, like he'd been holding this in just as long, like letting go was the easiest thing he'd ever done.

When they finally broke apart, both of them were breathing hard. Lukas's eyes were bright, his tail thumping against the roof like he couldn't control it anymore and had stopped trying.

"Sealed," Cody whispered against his muzzle.

Lukas pulled back just enough to look at him, amber eyes searching his face like he was memorizing every detail. Then he lifted Cody's hand to his mouth and nipped his fingertip, gentle but deliberate. "Sealed."

For a long moment neither of them moved. Just breathing. Just being. The weight of the word settling between them like something solid, something real, something that couldn't be taken back.

Then Lukas tugged him down and they lay back together, closer this time, Cody's head on Lukas's chest, the wolf's arm wrapped around him like he was never letting go. The steady thump of Lukas's heartbeat against his ear was the best sound Cody had ever heard.

"We should head back," Lukas said eventually. "Security does rounds."

"Yeah."

Neither of them moved.

"Five more minutes," Cody said.

"Five more minutes."

They watched the stars. The empty stadium held them like a secret, and for the first time in a long time, Cody felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.

# Epilogue: What Quiet Sounds Like

Tuesday morning. Four days since the game, three days since Cody last set foot in an administrative building. Yesterday's statements had taken most of the afternoon, the whole pack retelling everything one by one while a recorder captured every word. Today Morrison had called just Cody back in, and Cody had insisted the others come too.

So here they were, crammed into the Associate Dean's office like they were waiting for a verdict. Benji perched on the arm of a chair, one leg bouncing. Gem stood by the window with her arms crossed, watching the quad below. Thorne took up most of the small couch, and Lukas sat beside Cody in one of the two chairs facing Morrison's desk, close enough that their shoulders touched.

Morrison shuffled papers, adjusted his glasses, cleared his throat. He was a deer, middle-aged, the kind of administrator who probably went into education wanting to help students and ended up buried in paperwork instead. Right now he looked like a guy delivering news he'd rehearsed six times in the mirror.

"First, the update on Dean Graves." Morrison folded his hands on the desk. "He's been formally charged and is currently incarcerated pending trial. Given the evidence, including Mr. Quillfoot's footage and Miss Kindler's documentation, the prosecutor is confident. You may be subpoenaed to testify, Mr. Guiles. We'll provide support through that process if it comes to it."

Cody nodded. He'd expected that part.

"Second." Morrison pulled a folder from his desk drawer and set it between them. "The university's legal counsel has asked me to present you with an offer."

Here it comes, Cody thought.

"In exchange for not pursuing legal action against Timberwood Hollow University..." Morrison opened the folder, turned it so Cody could read. "Full scholarship. Tuition, room and board, meal plan, books, and supplies. All covered for the duration of your undergraduate degree." He paused. "I understand you expressed interest in journalism. We have an excellent program. You'd be enrolled as a freshman starting spring semester, with provisional status until your documentation is fully processed."

The words sat there, black ink on university letterhead. Cody stared at them and felt something sour twist in his gut.

"So let me get this straight." His voice came out flatter than he intended. "Your dean kidnaps me, straps me to a table, and plans to do god knows what to my insides, and in exchange for not suing you into the ground, I get a free ride."

Morrison had the decency to look uncomfortable. "I understand how this might feel."

"Do you?" Cody leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice.

"Cody." Gem's voice, quiet from the window. He glanced over. She gave him a look that said take the deal, idiot.

Lukas's knee pressed against his under the desk, steady and grounding.

Cody looked back at the paperwork. Full scholarship, meal plan, books, the whole package. Everything he would have killed for back home, handed to him because a university was terrified of a lawsuit. It was hush money dressed up in academic language, and they all knew it.

But it was also a future. A real one. The kind he'd stopped believing in somewhere between his mother's funeral and his father's fists.

"Where do I sign?" The words came out tired, resigned, but he meant them.

Morrison's shoulders dropped about two inches with relief. He produced a pen, pointed to three separate lines, and Cody signed his name on each one. Cody Guiles. Cody Guiles. Cody Guiles. Like he was making himself real, one signature at a time.

When it was done, Morrison stood and extended his hand. "Welcome to Timberwood, Mr. Guiles. Officially."

Cody shook it. The grip was firm, and unless Cody's read on people had completely failed him, the warmth in Morrison's eyes was genuine. Not everyone at this university was a monster. Just the one who mattered most.

"Now get out of my office," Morrison said, and there was almost a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "Go enjoy your Tuesday."

The dining hall was loud and warm and smelled like fried food and cheap coffee, which was exactly what Cody needed after that office. They commandeered a table near the back, away from the windows, and within ten minutes Thorne had accumulated enough food to feed a small army.

"So you're official now." Benji was grinning so wide it looked like it hurt. "Cody Guiles, Timberwood University freshman. Got a nice ring to it."

"Sounds fake," Cody said, but he was smiling too.

"Sounds expensive." Gem sat down with a tray that held a salad and a cup of tea. "For them, I mean. Full ride? They must be terrified of what you could do to their reputation."

"Good," Lukas said. "They should be."

Thorne grunted in agreement, which for Thorne was practically a speech.

Benji launched into a retelling of the Jumbotron hack that Cody had now heard four times, but somehow it got more elaborate with each version. This time there were "military-grade firewalls" and "a three-second window before the whole system crashed" and Cody was pretty sure none of that was true, but Benji's quills were practically vibrating with pride so nobody corrected him.

Gem rolled her eyes but didn't interrupt. Thorne ate. Lukas's tail found its way around Cody's waist under the table, warm and solid, and stayed there.

"Oh!" Benji pointed his fork at Lukas. "Pay up, by the way."

Lukas raised an eyebrow.

"The bet. From Saturday." Benji turned to Cody. "How long before you stopped looking over your shoulder every five seconds. I gave you a month. Lukas said a week." He counted on his fingers. "Six days since you got here. He wins."

"You bet on me?" Cody's eyebrows shot up.

"We bet on your recovery," Benji corrected. "Very supportive. Very wholesome."

"I hate both of you." But Cody was fighting a grin, and losing badly.

"You love us," Benji said. "Also Lukas won, so technically he's buying lunch, which means I'm ordering dessert. Thorne, you want pie? I want pie. We're getting pie."

Thorne was already standing, headed for the dessert line. Benji scrambled after him.

Gem watched them go, then turned back to Cody and Lukas with something that might have been a smile. "You two are disgusting, by the way."

"We're not doing anything," Cody said.

"His tail has been around your waist for ten minutes." Gem gestured with her tea cup at the furry evidence in question.

Lukas didn't move it. "And?"

Gem shook her head, but she was definitely smiling now. "I'm happy for you. Both of you." She stood, picked up her tea. "I'm going to go make sure Benji doesn't order the entire dessert case. Try not to be too disgusting while I'm gone."

Then it was just the two of them, surrounded by the noise of the dining hall, Lukas's tail still warm against Cody's hip.

"So," Lukas said. "How's it feel? Being official."

Cody thought about it. "Weird. Good weird." He looked down at his tray, at the dining hall food that was now technically his dining hall food, at the table where his pack was sitting, at the wolf beside him who'd broken down a door to find him. "Like maybe I'm actually allowed to be here now."

Lukas's paw found his under the table. Squeezed once. "You were always allowed."

After lunch they walked. No destination, no hurry, just Cody and Lukas crossing campus in the early afternoon light. Lukas's tail had migrated from Cody's waist to a loose curl around his hip, and their shoulders bumped with every few steps. A few students glanced their way. A raccoon girl waved. Someone from the football team shouted something that was probably congratulations but might have been an innuendo. Lukas flipped him off without breaking stride.

It was halfway across the quad that Cody noticed it.

His brain was quiet.

Not scanning the crowd for threats. Not mapping exits or cataloging faces or running the constant background calculation of where danger might come from and how fast he could get away from it. For the first time in as long as he could remember, his head was just... still.

They rounded the corner by the old oak tree and there it was.

The science building stood gray and silent against the afternoon sky. Yellow tape crossed the main entrance in a bright X. A security officer sat on the steps, scrolling through his phone, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. And on the double doors, in black letters that caught the light:

**CLOSED**

Cody stopped walking.

Lukas's tail tightened around his hip. "You okay?"

Cody stared at the sign. He thought about fluorescent lights and cold metal and the sound of his own breathing echoing off tile walls. He thought about straps and needles and a snow leopard's patient smile. He thought about all the nights he might have spent in that building if things had gone differently, if his pack hadn't come for him, if Lukas hadn't broken down that door.

Then he looked at the CLOSED sign again. At the bored security guard. At the yellow tape that meant nobody was getting in, that the man who'd wanted to dissect him was sitting in a cell somewhere, that it was over.

"Yeah." He let out a slow breath, felt something loosen in his chest. "I really am."

Lukas bumped his shoulder. "Come on. Benji's buying dinner too."

"He lost the bet. You won." Cody poked Lukas in the ribs.

"And I'm makin' him pay for it all week." Lukas's tail gave a smug little wag.

Cody laughed, and it felt easy, felt real in a way laughing hadn't felt in years. He let Lukas pull him away from the science building, away from the yellow tape and the locked doors and everything they represented.

They walked through campus in the afternoon light, a wolf's tail around his waist and nowhere left to hide.

He didn't need to anymore.
